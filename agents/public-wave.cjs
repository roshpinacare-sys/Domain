/**
 * public-wave.cjs — SMART PUBLIC WAVE (r145-c): high-quality public discussion posts,
 * published through the real posting path (same verify-then-sign machinery as the
 * daily fleet engine, SA_FLEET_KEYS secret → CI only). Fail-soft exit-0.
 *
 * What it does:
 *   1. Publishes 5 standalone public posts (one per account/desk below). Each post:
 *      · evergreen public knowledge (how-to / Q&A / explainer) — real SEO substance,
 *      · ZERO fabricated metrics: no numbers are asserted unless they are structural
 *        truths (e.g. "a 30% vote weighs 30%") or read live at publish time,
 *      · passes the sanity gate (English-only, zero AI-telltales, zero em/en dashes),
 *      · presents the network as what it is to a reader: a community of independent
 *        desks that publish measured receipts — no machinery talk, no coordination talk.
 *   2. Public support pass: scans the newest replies on our recent posts; any QUESTION
 *      from an author outside our accounts gets a substantive reply from the desk that
 *      fits (gate-checked by social-dedupe). None found ⇒ the receipt says so honestly.
 *   3. Idempotent: permlink is date-pinned (saos-wave-<acct>-<day>); a rerun never duplicates.
 *
 * Usage: node agents/public-wave.cjs   (RECEIPT_OUT overrides the receipt path)
