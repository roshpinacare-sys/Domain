/**
 * dex-core.cjs — R42 THE MULTI-NETWORK VAULT (CR-0072 / feat-067 / E65, suite v1.50.0 → v1.51.0)
 * R40 landed the exchange core (CR-0070), R41 the mesh market (CR-0071). R42 extends the VAULT
 * across networks (the owner's law: "משהו חכם על הרשת שלנו שתוכל להחזיק מטבעות אמיתיים טוקנים
 * של כל הרשתות וגם שלנו"):
 *  - CUSTODY-CLASS LAW: what the vault may count as ITS OWN — MEASURED-KEYED (active keys in the
 *    protected desks + chain-measured → custody, the ONLY mintable class) / OBSERVED-POST-KEYED
 *    (posting key held — account controlled, transfers gated) / OBSERVED-UNCONTROLLED (the name
 *    exists, its active pub ≠ any held key — R38 law) / PLANNED-NO-CLAIM / OBSERVED-ABSENT.
 *  - The OBSERVED registry: adjacent networks (HIVE/HBD/BLURT) probed KEYLESSLY every tick and
 *    booked with provenance — the vault SEES every network and holds only what its keys can move.
 *  - ISSUER identity (SAOS-DEX-ISSUER/1): a stable recomputable identity over the wrapper set +
 *    chain bindings + pool catalog; the mint law (1:1 against MEASURED-KEYED custody only) and
 *    the peg-out corridors (per chain, honestly banded) hang off it — R11's corridor landed.
 *  - REDEEM law (the real-value law's second half): burn BEFORE payout — the in-ledger redeem is
 *    ALWAYS honored 1:1; the chain-side payout is QUEUED to dex/pegout-queue.json with its
 *    corridor named — a keyed desk owns the broadcast, keyless code never fires one.
 *  - Pool catalog P5-P9: WHIVE/HIVE, WHBD/HBD, WBLURT/BLURT pegs + P9 WSBD/WHBD (the SBD↔HBD
 *    dollar bridge) + P8 HIVE/STEEM (the cross-network bridge, cross-fair law) — appended to the
 *    live book by the deterministic reconcile law, arming the day key material verifies.
 *
 * Owner directive (2026-10-04, Hebrew, trace 1a105f6d58b6c3a5): "צריך לטפל בו היטב
 * לדאוג שנוכל לעשות שם החלפות swap וכו... חשוב שגם נוכל באמת להחליף למטבע האמיתי
 * עם ערך ולא סתם שקר... גרידים מתנגדים על הרשת שלנו מצד שני... שוק ארביטראז רישתי...
 * ראוטרים שנוכל לקבל ולהחליף גם כבר סכומים גדולים... משהו חכם על הרשת שלנו שתוכל
 * להחזיק מטבעות אמיתיים טוקנים של כל הרשתות וגם שלנו".
 *
 * R39 (dex-router.cjs) built the ROUTER — the venue graph, the honest verdicts, the
 * CEX-anchored counter-grids, the arb FLOOR law. R40 builds the CORE — the thing that
 * actually SETTLES swaps on our own network, atomically, deterministically, with real
 * reserve-backed value and zero lies:
 *
 *  - UNITS LAW: every amount is µ (1e-6) BigInt, end to end. No floats touch settlement.
 *  - TWO INVARIANTS, ONE ENGINE (the research verdict, R40-d):
 *      VOLATILE pools: constant-product x·y ≥ k (Uniswap v2, fee on input, floor to user,
 *        pool keeps the dust — UniswapV2Library.getAmountOut, exact).
 *      PEG pools: Curve stableswap (canonical 2020 formulation, A pinned at 10, Newton
 *        get_D/get_y with the 255-iteration cap, fee on output with the canonical −1 pad:
 *        dy = xpOut − y − 1 — the pool NEVER loses dust to the trader).
 *  - REAL-VALUE LAW (the owner's "לא סתם שקר"): wrapped WSTEEM/WSBD mint ONLY 1:1 against
 *    reserve custody actually held in the vault; REDEEM is ALWAYS honored 1:1 (burn before
 *    payout); reserve ratio is asserted on every tick and the attestation hash
 *    sha256(seq, custody, reserves, minted, claims) is booked so any node can re-verify.
 *  - ATOMICITY LAW: every swap carries minOut; out < minOut ⇒ REFUSED, state byte-unchanged.
 *  - CONSERVATION LAW (double-entry): custody[a] − wrappedReserve[a] − Σ claims[a] === 0
 *    asserted every tick, per asset, booked as a row the eval re-derives.
 *  - LEDGER LAW (event sourcing): state = book snapshot; every state change is an
 *    append-only op in dex-core-history.jsonl with a monotonic seq. The chain probe
 *    (measure phase) is itself an op with provenance — the powerdown drip enters the DEX
 *    as a DEPOSIT-DELTA the same hour it lands on headcorner. No code needed on drip day.
 *  - ARB / REBALANCE LAW (inherited from dex-router.cjs — single source of truth for the
 *    FLOOR math): when the pool's own price drifts from the CEX-implied fair beyond
 *    arbThreshold, the treasury rebalances AGAINST ITS OWN POOL — selling the overvalued
 *    side, capturing the premium as realized edge (marked to fair, fees and impact paid in
 *    full). Below the floor: a PLAN row, never a trade. This is the LVR defense: we are
 *    our own rebalancer, we capture what outside arbitrageurs would otherwise drain.
 *  - COUNTER-GRIDS, OUR SIDE: R39 grids anchored to the CEX fair (their side). R40 grids
 *    anchor to the POOL MID — our network's own price — with the same Avellaneda skew law
 *    (sign from the pool's inventory share) and the same spacing law. PLAN-POOL-GATED.
 *  - STASIS: halt-before-read (law 3). Fail-soft exit 0 always. Single-writer atomic book.
 *
 * Feed law: the core consumes the BOOKED dex-router.json (the hourly venue graph) —
 * measurement (router, network) and settlement (core, pure) are separated so the settle
 * path is deterministic and re-runnable byte-identically on the same inputs.
 *
 * R43 (CR-0073) adds the XC INTENT settlement path (settleXcOps / settle-xc): the cross-chain
 * intent doors drafted by dex-xc.cjs are applied HERE — the single balance universe. XC-OPEN
 * escrows owner claims into the xc-escrow account; XC-FILL routes the escrow through OUR pools
 * (ledger-dest) or through our pools + the redeem law (chain-dest — burn + pegout-queue row with
 * the corridor named); XC-CONFIRM clears the corridor exposure when the door's finality clock
 * passes; XC-REFUND returns the escrow WHOLE (the 2:1 HTLC clock law — refund unlocks only after
 * the fill window AND a full extra fill window). The BOND LAW (2:1, THORChain-adapted): the
 * vault's outstanding corridor exposure may never exceed 2× its custody of the payout asset.
 * Idempotency by escrow drain: a replayed fill finds the escrow empty and is refused. The core
 * stays dumb and safe — the doors, the clocks and the state machine live in dex-xc.cjs.
 *
 * R44 (CR-0074) arms THE OPPOSING HANDS — the two things the owner's directive left gated:
 *  - COUNTER-GRID ARM LAW: the pool-side counter-grids were born PLAN-POOL-GATED-NOT-BROADCAST
 *    (R39/R40) — the owner has now given the gate twice ("אני רוצה לייצר עוד גרידים מתנגדים על
 *    הרשת שלנו מצד שני", trace 1a105f6d58b6c3a5, and the rung trigger 1a1076497144c3ed). The
 *    gate is an ARTIFACT, not a boolean: agents/change-requests/CR-0074-counter-grids.json
 *    present in the repo = gate open. The arm adds the laws the broadcast needs: deterministic
 *    rung ids (sha256-16, idempotent re-arm), the CAP law (a grid's per-side notional ≤ 2% of
 *    that side's depth value marked to the anchor), the DUST law (a rung under GRID_DUST keeps
 *    the grid quiet — GRID-TOO-THIN, dust orders never rest), and the TWO-SIDED law (a grid
 *    without BOTH ladders is a direction bet, REFUSED — the essence of מתנגד is both hands).
 *    settle stays pure: the gate arrives as an argument, byte-determinism untouched.
 *  - PEGOUT HAND (agents/pegout-hand.cjs): the keyed consumer of dex/pegout-queue.json — the
 *    second half of the real-value law. DEST-ALLOWLIST law: a chain payout fires ONLY to an
 *    estate-roster account; a row naming a non-estate account is REFUSED-DEST-NOT-ESTATE
 *    (never a transfer to a squatter). The hand proves itself with a 0.001 self-transfer
 *    (value-neutral, receipted) — the rail is real, the queue law is enforced.
