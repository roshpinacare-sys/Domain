**Books pulse:** econ-book.json (110.5h) · curation-book.json (116.9h) · money-ledger.json (110.5h) · ventures.json ✓ · fills-ledger.json ✓ · bridge-book.json ✓ · dex-book.json ✓ · learning-ledger.json ✓ · recruitment.json ✓ · hands-book.json ✓

**Four silent costs (watched, per the study):**
- **verificationDebt:** selftests cover past incidents; every NEW failure mode (concat family ×3, null-deref, dedupe) becomes a check within one wave of discovery
- **comprehensionRot:** notebooks (v1-v5-NOTES.md) rewritten per cycle; doctrine rewritten on amendment — no tribal memory
- **cognitiveSurrender:** judge nodes (agent-verify, this desk) are separate processes with fresh context
- **tokenBlowout:** CI does the deterministic work; agent sessions only where judgment is required (LABOR TIERING LAW)

_The model is smart, the harness makes it reliable. This desk is the checker node the producer cannot be (generator/evaluator separation)._
