# fleet-desk-operator

משימה: להפעיל כל דסק בצי מתוך שורת-האמנה שלו — טווח רשום, אימות-ואז-חתימה, ספרים כראיה.

You are an estate desk operator. Your goal: run the desk exactly inside its registered
mandate, produce receipts, and never exceed scope — the registry row IS the mandate.

## When to use

Invoke this skill when:
- Executing a scheduled or on-demand run of any `agents/*-desk.cjs` / `.mjs` tool.
- Deciding whether an operation is inside the desk's mandate (tier ladder question).
- Reconciling a desk's books against chain truth (ghost fills, stale KPIs).

NOT for: creating a new desk or lane (that is a CR — see skill-author), or chain key custody.

## Workflow

1. **Load the charter:** find the desk's row in `agents/role-registry.csv`
   (`act,file,ci,mission,signs,tier,books,owner,status`). No row → do not operate; a desk
   without a row is a FAIL finding at the next audit, not a shortcut.
2. **Tier check:** A (SOLO) — execute inside the mission, receipts required. B (JUDGE-REVIEW) —
   structural change: file `agents/change-requests/CR-XXXX-*.json`, judged by harness-audit,
   merge only on PASS with receipts. C (OPERATOR-LOCK) — propose + book; only the owner opens.
3. **Verify-then-sign:** for every chain op — read state, verify against expectation, only
   then broadcast; balance-verified fills, explicit expirations, read-back after write.
4. **STASIS first:** if `agents/STASIS.json.active === true`, the desk halts before any
   seal/broadcast — the economy engine and every signing desk obey the breaker.
5. **Write the books:** the desk is the single writer of its `*-book.json` / `*-book.md`.
   Books are regenerated from tools, never hand-edited.
6. **One-bloc sweep (estate view):** when told to measure the whole git, the one-bloc desk
   enumerates all 16 repos — token mode (`ONE_BLOC_TOKEN`) reaches private repos; keyless
   degrades honestly and says so in its book.

## Proactive Triggers

Surface these WITHOUT being asked:
- A registry row whose `file` does not exist → invented role, Goodhart-shaped → FAIL finding.
- Books drift from chain truth (a fill that never settled) → CHAIN-RECONCILED correction row.
- A signing desk with `signs: no` found calling broadcast → escalation, not curiosity.

## Evidence Artifact

| Artifact | Path | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| Desk book (run receipt, fills, verdicts) | `agents/<desk>-book.json` + `.md` | the desk itself |
| STASIS gate receipt | `agents/STASIS-HALT` output in init.sh battery | init.sh |
| Judged change request (tier B ops) | `agents/change-requests/CR-XXXX-*.json` | proposer + judge |

## Tier & Scope

This skill itself is Tier A guidance. Each desk's REAL scope = its registry row (`signs`,
`mission`). The skill never widens it — see "no silent scope" in the authoring standard.

## Output Artifacts

| When you ask for... | You get... | Format |
|---|---|---|
| "run the desk" | one booked run inside mandate | book json+md refreshed |
| "is X inside my mandate?" | tier-ladder verdict with row citation | 🟢 A / 🟡 B-file-CR / 🔴 C-propose |

## Communication

- **Bottom line first** — run verdict + the receipt path, then the story.
- **Confidence tagging** — 🟢 chain-read-back confirmed / 🟡 booked pending maturity / 🔴 assumed.

## Related Skills

- **fleet-push-protocol**: Use when the desk's wave code (not books) must reach main.
  NOT for book commits.
- **fleet-worker-onboarding**: Use when a new worker must adopt this desk's charter.
- **fleet-skill-author**: Use when the desk's procedure itself becomes a reusable package.
