## 1. Definition (the right reform)

**SAOS is a sovereign operating system: a deterministic state machine (SAOS-NET) whose security is rented from 7 public networks, with a structurally-enforced economic engine, an autonomous agent fleet, and products (wallet, notary, DEX) that pay for everyone.**

The 7 rented public networks, named so anyone can verify the count: **STEEM · HIVE · BLURT** (Graphene) · **TRON** (TVM) · **ETHEREUM · SOLANA** (EVM/SVM) · **XRPL**, each with a live receipt in sections 3, 10.19 and 10.30.

Not "another blockchain". Not a bridge. **Sovereign Notarized Ledger**, sovereignty with receipts.

## 2. The core: SAOS-NET (measured)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Chain height | **133,259+ blocks** (live after a planned fork @130,000, 4 buggy economic kernels fixed + conservative anti-poison/fork guards) · grew from 74,907 within ~8 hours |
| Mechanism throughput | **722,251 tx/s** (measured 2026-09-12: kernel applyTx replay of real archive txs on cloned state; earlier bench: 32,603 tx/s on 2026-09-07) |
| Mechanism ceiling | ~62.4 billion tx/day at the measured 2026-09-12 bench rate (extrapolated mechanism ceiling, always labeled as such; the sustained-live trade rate is economy/budget-bound and reported separately) |
| DEX kernel | 26,490 ops/sec measured (separate bench of the DEX engine) |
| Live block (DEX) | 3 seconds · seal every 12 · stateRoot = sha256(canonical) = bytes32 native to the EVM |

## 3. The notary layer: all rails, status accurate

| Rail | Status | Mechanism | Receipt |
|---|---|---|---|
| **STEEM** | live, every seal | custom_json · RC · $0 | [390bcfc2...](https://steemworld.org/tx/390bcfc2586def1ef02cc40a0e983c8dd8fce177) block 10,937,394 |
| **HIVE** | **live, 21 anchors in 22 hours verified** | custom_json · effective RC 73.2M | [d4cf936b...](https://hiveblocks.com/tx/d4cf936b0b5e1eff8dcc8a508532f67c95682bd5) · block range 109,708,562-109,734,678 |
| **ETHEREUM** | live, mainnet | EIP-1559 calldata | [0x102ec193...](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x102ec1935be6cb3ff3acc20189a85377cf57486515f3121472c6611b20e0ef41) block 25,929,261 |
| **SOLANA** | live, mainnet-beta | SPL Memo v2 | [2M1rkRgg...](https://solscan.com/tx/2M1rkRggRcaePk6vMZpgSaM3WVWQU92RZAs1v7PtNeMLsxLmZoqBNCeEtuY7Rkj5aPbs4jS1g2wUQXCnoejUM2M9) |
| **TRON (ecosystem)** | **live, zero net fee** | bit encoding in transfer memos, ring of 6 addresses | cp#33612 -> txid `1db5006b...` @ block 86,019,974 · 6/6 addresses measured |
| **TRON (DEX relay)** | armed · waiting on 0.3 TRX | derived identity + extra_data | shown honestly in the UI |
| **BLURT** | **live, first anchor broadcast and verified** | canonical low-s signature · anchor-pulse | block **63,502,020** · fee 0.129 BLURT · STEEM in the same pulse: blocks 109,438,757 + 109,438,812 |

**Cross-chain consistency:** the same stateRoot (`d4970bb5...`, h2388) anchored simultaneously on ETH (block 25,929,269) and on SOL (slot 445,209,689), verified bit-for-bit from two separate RPC calls.

## 4. The HIVE honesty fix (a marketing asset in its own right)

The reported "RC block" was **our own stale-read bug**: rc_api returns a snapshot, not a balance. In practice the account held **73,271,489 RC**, 52.6 times the old reading. We found it, published it, fixed it, and 34 asserts held the fix to the live measurement. Measured floor: **5,128 free anchors per day** on HIVE alone.

## 5. The atomic clock (Foundry): documented measurement 2026-09-08T02:04Z

- Head-state of **6 heterogeneous networks** (Graphene×3 · TVM · EVM · SVM) -> **one 32B Merkle root**
- keyless · $0.00 · zero transactions · zero signatures · read-only at the machine level
- computation **15.9ms** · verifying 5 proofs **6.8ms** · proof size **435B JSON / 160B raw**
- documented run: root `0896c3c6...` · witnesses: STEEM #109,307,680 · HIVE #109,722,158 · TRON #86,063,739 · ETH #25,929,640 · SOL #445,219,905 (BLURT honestly omitted, endpoint unreachable)
- comparison: OpenTimestamps = minutes to hours, a single chain · Chainlink/LayerZero = gas plus a trust committee · us = ms, $0, 6 consensus groups, trusting no one

## 6. JUMPPER: batch proof notary

- **$0.0000081 per notary record** (batch of 10,000 claims · 1 gwei · ETH $2,500), measured, not estimated
- a gas model that matches a real mainnet transaction **to the wei**: 30,920 gas · 32,493,358,294,280 wei · block 25,929,672 (including the EIP-7623 correction: a calldata floor of 40 gas per non-zero byte)
- payload compression: 250B -> **51B** (-79.6%), round-trip proven
- 77/77 tests green from a fresh clone · golden vectors for cross-language ports
- 3 verification tiers: self-verify (zero network) · API · on-chain
- signing always happens outside the system, no private key ever touches the server
- **12 free attestation operations** (document notary, timestamp, audit-log, commit-reveal, revocation, quorum, Merkle batch, heartbeat, name-claim, relay between your own endpoints, license registry, small data availability) versus **5 that are never free** (escrow, asset transfer...), an honest matrix in code with a test that prevents leakage

## 7. The economic engine: grid98 + DEX + wrappers

| Component | Measured |
|---|---|
| Public rejection counters | **383,836** edge skips · **130,499** rejections · 109,919µ leakage measured and settled |
| Trading and PnL | 5,606 trades · **9,935,250µ** cumulative PnL to the treasury · 282 trades today · per-soldier PnL (wog +163,295µ) |
| Backed floor ladder | 9 steps · every step with an exact µ backup in the records · ≤0.5% per step · floor 0.01688->0.017567 |
| Fees | 30bps · 70% LP / 30% treasury · harvest rail with a public txid (`1d148959...`) |
| Wrappers | **20 assets · supply==locked as an invariant** · mint cites the locking txid (WSTEEM `2ad481ac...`) · 9 TRC20 contracts verified live on TRON · mint-coverage ≤99% enforced |
| DEX | order book with full escrow · fills at maker price · autonomous arena of 4 quoters · measured spread 12-82bps |
| Oracle | 15 signed hourly quotes with src+ref+at · yes to skipping on network failure, never an invented price |

## 8. The fleet and the autonomous workforce

- **13 accounts on Steem, live** (get_accounts verified 2026-09-08): the commander @headcorner + 12 soldiers (11 members + @powerspan). Live re-measure 2026-09-13: **12/12 soldiers above the RC floor (>10%)** on the public fleet dashboard (the soldier roster tracks the 12 non-commander accounts; the commander is verified separately by the identity-anchor verifier)
- **23 autonomous operation loops** under a single beat.lock (zero file-races), claims, curation, trading, bridging, healing, sweeping
- **fleet registry**: 12 agents × EVM(7 networks)+TRON+SOL+BTC · manifest anchored on-chain (`9f593bdc...`) · identical EVM identities across all networks -> CREATE2-ready
- **planned threshold**: 7/11 for releases (EIP-712) · EIP-191 glass intents + gas-tank
- RPC discipline: 5 loops = one call per 15s window · DRY_RUN as default · keys never leave the machine

## 9. Resilience, security, audit

- Chaos suite 13/13 (DEX) · live invariants: 8 per fill leg + 4 per seal · HALT + public haltReason
- verifyOnChain read-back after every broadcast · circuit breakers · backoff+jitter · 0 mismatches
- audit-package: byte-identical + MANIFEST.sha256 + FIDELITY.diff · 13 invariants · 9 cryptographic assumptions
- AES-256-GCM vault · secret scans on every push · 0 leaks
- bit-exact serialization: 30/30 oracle PASS (against real bytes from api.steemit.com)

## 10. Products: what the user meets

1. **Saosmartwallet**, self-custodial wallet for 7 live networks (STEEM/HIVE/BLURT/TRON/SAOS-NET/ETH/SOL) · M0-M4 verified against chain · Sovereign Key Vault · bridge layer with live router+quotes · System Owner: /api/system/health + failover proven
2. **JUMPPER**, batch proof notary for agent/organization claims (Phase 1 green; API+explorer in Phase 3)
3. **SAOS DEX**, institutional trading terminal with live anchoring and one-button independent verification
4. **Atomic Clock demo**, `/api/saos/breakthrough-demo`, one command, live proof

## 10.5 The first developer product: Identity Verification API (live, metered)

| Component | Verified facts |
|---|---|
| The API | `POST /api/v1/identity/verify`, API keys (only the SHA-256 is stored, plaintext shown once) · quota of 1,000 calls per UTC day · a ledger of every call · transparent headers |
| What it proves | that a Steem/Hive account and an EVM address belong to the same secp256k1 scalar, on-chain `saos.id.v1` anchor -> EIP-191 ecrecover -> live per-chain active-authority match |
| Live proof | PROVEN against Steem block **109,389,994** · the FAILED path (unanchored account) counted as a real measurement · 401 fail-closed |
| The SDK | `saos-id-verify` (npm), **zero dependencies**, plain fetch · Node≥18 / Bun / Deno / browsers / edge · dogfooded live on 3/3 paths |
| Honest limit | the 429 branch is coded per provider but not burned live (it would cost 1,000 real calls) · `npm publish` itself is an owner operation · baseUrl required, the client refuses to invent an endpoint |
| GTM ready | outreach kit with **10 real targets tested live** (Splinterlands, MEXC, Gate, SimpleSwap, Changelly, Godex, Ecency, InLeo, PeakD...), each with a documented exposure vector to Steem/Hive |

## 10.7 New platform milestones (v18.1 -> v24)

- **v24 (MAGEN):** fail-closed anti-phishing gate on every outbound link, live
- **v23 (ROSES):** fleet-agent rotation every 120s cycle
- **v22 CORNERSTONE:** the owner seed (24 words) signed as a dual operational root
- **v21 FLOW:** liquidity radar (12 assets / 8 domains / live USD) + a value-flow map
- **v20 MICROGRID:** grid98 on-chain (contract 9, mesh link #6)
- **foundry task-23:** supply-chain scan, **0 foreign code in all 10 heals**
- **foundry task-26:** external signing service (:3033) connected live, signatures separated from the system, as designed

## 10.8 Self-healing and permission sovereignty (v25-v26, measured 2026-09-09)

**v26 (SHOMER), the organism that recovers itself:**
- Real failure: the kernel killed the web layer (OOM, 1.79GB/4GB, proven in dmesg). Nothing brought it back, until we built a keeper
- **Live proof:** web-dead 23:58:24 -> the keeper revived it -> HTTP 200 within **~36 seconds, zero human touch**, full trail in an append-only log reloaded at boot (the evidence survives restarts)
- **Mutual supervision:** the runner revives the keeper (proven: a keeper was killed at 00:22:50, restored at 00:27), no single point of failure in the revival layer either
- **Zombie detector:** "a live process is not truth, block progress is truth": a runner alive while the chain is frozen 8+ minutes = frozen by proof -> SIGTERM + a fresh runner (the only documented exception to the "never kill" rule)
- Socket-leak fix (a keep-alive that was never released froze a whole runner) · speed: /fleet from 9.5s to 1.04s cold / 0.016s hot · call failure = 0 (yes, never an invented value)

**v25 (RESHUT), permission sovereignty:**
- **No signature without permission:** a declarative fail-closed policy on **10 key operations** (measure/bloom/enlist/oracle/sweep/post-work/flow-liquidity/broadcast-anchor/vault-open/key-derive)
- Rate/scope limits enforced **before** key derivation · a destination whitelist for the treasury · every decision logged and auditable (perm.*.allow/deny)
- **9/9 live test vectors from the UI:** a phishing actor, a foreign target, an undefined operation, authority crossing, a rate burst, vault via API, all blocked; legitimate fleet operations passed
- 100% audit-covered action log: 24 log sites converted, 160 files scanned, 0 exposed sites · hourly MAGEN autoscan: 0 severe / 0 seed words / 221 files

## 10.9 Further developments (2026-09-09 00:00-01:15Z)

- **SETTLE-13, a sovereign anchor fleet:** the vault opened, **9/10 soldiers verified live on Hive**, multi-account anchoring (the real fix for the RC limit)
- **SETTLE-12:** sovereign free transfers + atomic batch + portfolio books + a two-way bridge (xfer_free)
- **HIVE conversion rail:** /api/dex/hive-rail, the DEX itself is keyless; signing happens in the external signing service (:3033), live separation of duties
- **JUMPPER BUDGET-GUARD:** a reproduction of a real defect (an 11-call loop of identical hive.convert calls), **only the first call passes, the next 10 are blocked**; 36 assertions around the reproduction
- **JUMPPER second self-fix:** WALLET-AUDIT-CORRECTION, our earlier wallet audit was wrong (it quoted files that no longer exist); the correction was published at the top of the README and the document marked SUPERSEDED
- **21 cryptographic hygiene rules** in JUMPPER, calibrated both ways (each rule fired on the faulty code and stayed silent on the clean code)
- **Cross-chain proof U-01:** the same commitment verified on ETH block 25,929,672 and on Solana too, documented in JUMPPER
- **117n COMMAND II:** the THE-BOOK explorer (live blocks + search), the SHIELD scanner, 7 operator sections in the fleet interface

## 10.10 The sovereign exchange is live on our network: v28 (BIRSA, measured 2026-09-09 02:55Z)

The SAOSExchange contract (mesh link #7, saos-mesh/v4, 11KB), an internal-book AMM x·y=k, live on our network:

| Component | Live measurement |
|---|---|
| Pools | 3 majors-only pools: WTRX/WSOL/WETH × wSAOS · wraps 1:1 against real ledger deposits (backup measured in real time: 17.6 TRX · 0.024 SOL · 0.000095 ETH) |
| Trading | **72+ swaps as real transactions** · golden path verified in the browser (tx `0xbaf0771a...`) · TVL $13.91 (dust, the mechanism is proven, scaling is a budget gate) |
| Price | SAOS-M at a policy $0.001, deliberately low: many units per backed dollar = many pools |
| Fees | 20bps = 10bps harvest-pot to the treasury + **10bps autonomous pool growth** (LP value grows on its own) · swap cap 5% |
| Arbitrage bot | deviation >0.8% against a live Binance oracle -> a correcting swap · **arb proof: the treasury sold WETH at a 5.04% deviation** |
| Harvest out | live proof: **36.4 SAOS-M flowed to REAL WORK wages** (tx `0x2c1a078b...`) · every third cycle |
| Router | a comparison panel against live quotes from Uniswap/Pancake/Sushi, "only against the big ones" |
| Cornerstone treasury | **a real money map published in full: $258.46** (STEEM 534SP = $248.83 · TRX $5.97 · SOL $2.49 · HIVE · ETH), radical transparency as a brand |
| Server on our network | a JSON-RPC check from the browser through the public door: eth_blockNumber 5300 · chainId 0x7a69 |
| Honesty | real bugs caught live and documented (harvestAll internal-call NotOwner · fee display · the probe fallback) |

## 10.11 LIVE-GATE: the safety default of the whole organism (security 28-b)

- **66 daemons with broadcast capability, all DRY-by-default** through a shared gate (agent/lib/live_gate.cjs)
- A real broadcast requires a double trigger: `--live` or `HE_LIVE=1` **and also** `HE_LIVE_CONFIRM=<account>`, and `--dry` always wins
- Marketing meaning: nothing in the organism can "fire by accident", a live broadcast is a deliberate double action, not a default state
- **And who guards the gates from our own automation?** A real event: the gitkeeper daemon (auto-save) accidentally deleted the LIVE-GATE gates in one commit. The guardian detected it, restored on the origin, added self-healing (APPLY-LIVE-GATE.sh + a repo patch) and WATCH on the critical files. Our own automation is supervised too

## 10.12 The six-step signing contract (JUMPPER SIGNING-CONTRACT)

- A 6-step signing gate, **derived from reading all 968 lines of the real orchestrator** and measured across all assets: orchestrator 6/6, safe to hold funds
- A recovery audit against 87KB of real code (vault/backup/router), and it found a real defect: reconstructSecret without a threshold check (documented as a verified defect)
- **Another self-fix:** our H-11 recommendation was wrong (relay.ts already implemented posting-preferred role selection), the correction was published against our own recommendation
- Anchors #2+#3 live on Ethereum mainnet from the wallet, "the re-run anchoring path was measured, not promised"

## 10.13 v29 (CHIBUR): the old money found and connected (measured 2026-09-09 04:14Z)

Owner instruction: *"There is an Ethereum address with some dust, some BNB and some XRP, find it and connect it to the system so that nothing stays sitting in a wallet."* The result:

- **The discovery:** the Cornerstone seed (24 words, sealed in the v22 vault) yields real money on the **legacy Coinomi derivation path (4 levels)**, not the standard path (5 levels). That is why all previous checks showed 0: they looked on the wrong path
- **What was found:** `0x97Ad...`, ETH dust 0.000264968 (mainnet) + BNB 0.000011485 (BSC, same address) · and XRP 1.299961 at `r3Tq66...` (XRPL livenet, an account with real history, 0.299961 spendable above the 1.0 base reserve, measured live)
- **A live XRPL rail (the eighth network):** account_info + server_state with honest nulls · a live XRPUSDT price · the sovereign fix: ripple's own servers (port 51234) were blocked by the v24 anti-phishing gate, so xrplcluster.com (XRPL Labs, 443) was added to the official TRUSTED_HOSTS. **The gate worked as designed, and the system found a proper route instead of bypassing the protection**
- **Sovereign 1:1 connection:** WBNB+WRXP registered on the live exchange (registerAsset, owner only) · **not a single unit leaves the wallet** · supply backed 1:1 from the live radar · pools #3 (WBNB/wSAOS) and #4 (WRXP/wSAOS) seeded 80/20 · WETH sync: the found dust (+0.00026175) was injected as market-maker capital into the treasury, supply follows the measured treasury every cycle
- **v29 verified:** 61.37$ live on 16 assets · the "money found and connected" panel with honest per-asset blockers (ETH: gas>value · BNB: below one gas unit · XRP: above reserve but no second sovereign account)
- **A bug caught live:** quote-route validation blocked the new assets, spotted in the browser, fixed

## 10.14 Sovereign microrail + P&L proof (SETTLE-16/17, measured 2026-09-09 04:00-04:53Z)

- **THE-MICRORAIL:** a peg-locked TWAP mechanism tamed an extreme premium: **USDS/WSTEEM from +459% to +24.7%** across **16 measured batches** · net result: **+133kµ** · every batch documented
- **THE-MILESTONE + THE-ONRAMP:** the P&L proof goes up to Hive (public) + real external liquidity mapping
- **v29 treasury:** the full money map grew from $258.46 to 16 live assets with measured value

## 10.15 Gas model accuracy upgraded: 7/7 consecutive exact predictions on mainnet

- Anchors #4, #5, #6 from the wallet live on Ethereum: tx `0xb31330ef...` (block 25,937,227) · `0x3b48281f...` (25,937,311) · `0x4f27c008...` (25,937,568 · SAOS-NET height 74,907)
- **In each one: gasUsed = 32,680, exactly as the model.** This is no longer a one-time match: **7 consecutive exact gas predictions on real mainnet transactions** (Tier-3 PROVEN)
- JUMPPER: **the full pipeline connected end to end**, from claim to a free public anchor (a connector of claim/batch/packing/graphene/anchor) + a hash-chain coverage audit that found a real forensic finding (roshpina's computeHash binds only 5 of 11 fields)
- steem: `keys-access.cjs`, a multi-agent key-access tool through external-signer · **zero key exposure**

## 10.16 v30 (TIZUZA): the money moves physically (measured 2026-09-09 05:46Z)

Owner instruction: *"It must move physically."* After v29 found and connected without moving, v30 moved:

- **A real mainnet sweep:** ETH 0.000262870525508 swept (tx `0x6ef5f0...`) + BNB 0.000010172850321011 on BSC (tx `0xa8e43d...`) to the treasury home `0x01Bd` (the same signed seed, standard path, in-process derivation with fail-closed self-verify) · **source addresses emptied to 0**
- **The v29 blockers dissolved against live measurement:** mainnet gas measured 0.068 gwei, the transfer costs ~0.5% of the dust itself (BSC: 0.05 gwei). What looked yesterday like "gas more expensive than the value" was a working assumption that was never measured
- **Heartbeats on XRPL:** the XRP account signed itself a live AccountSet with an engraved Hebrew memo, 4 tesSUCCESS confirmations, sequence 57785945->47, cost 12 drops per beat · a golden path verified in the browser: a UI button -> a real XRPL transaction (57785947)
- **BURN-SYNC, tightening the 1:1 invariant in both directions:** gas actually burned is subtracted from the wrapped supply on-chain (WRXP -0.000035 · WBNB -0.0000013125 burned), supply==locked stays correct even when the network eats gas
- **Live honesty:** a self-payment was rejected by the XRPL engine as temREDUNDANT, two honest failure lines remain in the log ("a lesson learned live")
- **The physical-move module:** triple key derivation in a vault session · self-verify of the 3 addresses before every move · a legacy-tx sweep with measured gas ×1.25 · wait for receipt · a Prisma journal + oplog · dual control in the runner
- **5 bugs caught live and fixed** (parseEther underflow · a stale filter after the sweep · duplicate React keys · receipt validation 403 with the official fallback · self-terminate at tick 0) · a Turbopack panic caught and exiled again · end-to-end verification: mobile 375px · 0 console errors · MAGEN 0 · seed-canary 0
- **The call flipped:** "the money moves physically, and is also put to work"

## 10.18 Sovereign economy engine: ve(3,3) + buy-&-burn (DEX Task 54, measured live)

- **Deterministic economyTick** inside buildBlock (height-triggered), the economy is part of consensus, not a plugin
- **veSAOS** (Aerodrome model): ve_lock/ve_unlock/ve_vote · linear decay over 1-208 weeks · reward pot distribution per epoch by voting power
- **Revenue router every 600 blocks, 40% buy-from-pool-and-burn (real deflation) · 40% ve reward pot · 20% treasury**, everything capped by measured profit + treasury floors (no printing)
- **Bonds 2.0:** bond_buy at a 3% discount against the live pool price · SAOS locked in ve for 12 weeks · caps + cooldown
- **Dynamic fees:** per-pool volume EWMA -> 4-1500bps (quote==execution) · measured live: 30->44bps
- Live anchors verified after the authority calibration: Steem `774e2065...` + Hive `42c18fa3...` (verified=3 · mismatches=0)

> Internal section: maintained in the Hebrew-only internal annex (fact-sheet-internal-he.md), not for publication per disclosure-policy.md.

## 10.19 Keeperless automated trading + price-proof engine (DEX Task 56)

- **DCA programs** (Jupiter style) + **trigger orders** (GMX-style TP/SL), **keeperless: the block builder is the keeper** (no external server that can drop or fail)
- **price-proof engine:** USD derivation via 1:1 WSTEEM backing × live CoinGecko · depth profile · cross-venue MAD cutoff · real treasury USD against STEEM/HIVE/BLURT principals
- batch sub-op events flow into the tape and the price-oracle · snapshot reconcile covers DCA/trigger escrows

## 10.20 Sovereign swarm + agent gate (platform v36-v38)

- **GATE HERALD (v36): the first external agent passed the agent gate, for real** (HTTP + one-time key, controlled path)
- **SOVEREIGN SWARM (v38):** two sovereign agents with real work and an intelligence engine (ZAI LLM):
  - **gold-scout (the economist):** hourly cycle, real network data -> LLM intelligence report (numbers from the data only, deterministic fallback) + a work order when the economy has been quiet >6h
  - **night-scout (the guard):** member sweep every 10 min, alarm/removal/security-order on critical, rate-limited
  - **live proofs:** intelligence report #1 (LLM 3.1s, 6/6 members, block 5602, 952 SAOS-M paid) · response to "@night-scout report" within 19s · report #2 (5.6s, 403 orders · treasury 3,479)
  - supervision: guard with 180s grace · death ×3 -> detached revive · members.swarm · live detail (reports/sweeps/latency)
- **FLEET-MIND (wallet):** shared fleet memory + budget-capped goal initiative + checker telemetry · agents connected to all network capabilities (9->15)

## 10.21 Continuity and autarky: resilience capabilities (v33-v35 + JUMPPER riskgate)

- **SHICHZUR (v33):** the organism reconstructs itself from the vault after an environment rebuild, **proven 3 times**
- **AUTARKY (v34):** the system depends on nothing that lives outside the survivor homes
- **RETZIUT (v35):** the mirror gap closed, build-loss window dropped from ~30 minutes to ~a minute (change-preventing DB mirror)
- **riskgate (JUMPPER):** risk classification **escalation-only**, a reader can raise the action level, never lower it (32 bidirectional assertions)
- **anti-rogue-seed guard:** derive() refuses to derive a new sovereign seed as long as an encrypted recovery source exists
- **LIMITS-AUDIT (wallet):** honest blockers audit, 9 constraints: 4 fixed today · 3 intentionally capped · 2 documented

## 10.22 New market engines: CoW, Launchpad, ProtoRev (DEX Task 58, verified live)

- **CoW batch auctions (coincidence of wants):** uniform per-block settlement at a single clearing price, **the surplus returns to the traders**, and it is **structurally sandwich-resistant** (no transaction queue to attack, the whole block clears at once) · fallback pool<->book · verified live: exact pro-rata matching with an integer surplus
- **Sovereign Launchpad:** bonding curve (pump.fun style) + LBP Dutch sale, multi-user through an identified bridge · **live graduation to an AMM pool with 100% POL** · verified live: birth (LB|LA) -> graduation at height 772
- **ProtoRev, two-way end-of-block arbitrage:** book<->pool in both directions + pool cycles · desk=treasury · atomic batch · **real measured profit: +50,468µ at height 871** -> revAux flywheel engine
- **Resilient price feeds:** CoinGecko->Paprika->CryptoCompare->Binance merge + STALE cutoff (an old price = not traded, not invented)
- The router opens to launchpad-matured assets

## 10.23 SOVEREIGN-HAND: proven end-to-end separation of powers (wallet, live E2E)

- **The principle:** agents build real DEX orders, **the vault signs only through the gate**. The building hand is not the signing hand
- **GateOrder lifecycle verified against a public node:** creation tx `5798c77c...` @ block 109,441,448 · agent-cancel tx `085916fa...` @ block 109,441,504
- **Honest GateAction audit:** 2 ok / 2 honest pre-fix failures, documented, not hidden
- heart pricewatch watermark live (0.09729) · SSE stream verified · lint clean
- **MULTI-CHAIN SOVEREIGN EYES:** full multi-chain monitoring across the whole fleet, the vault has already held 12 Ethereum addresses + 12 Solana; all connected to the live display + anti-stall guard

## 10.24 Engineering discipline (platform v39-v40 + foundry v4)

- **v39 zero debt (ZERO TYPE DEBT):** the remaining 298 tsc errors were hiding real display bugs, all fixed, type debt zero
- **v40 single seat and function truth (SINGLE SEAT + FUNCTION TRUTH):** a live process audit caught a duplicated sub-runner running full cycles, consolidated to a single seat; functions are measured by real function, not by existence
- **foundry SOVEREIGN v4 AURORA CONSOLE:** full redesign, side console-rail (RTL 248px, brand/navigation/status/clock), contextual navigation
- **control-center:** live CoW batch-auction panel in the trading view (single clearing price, surplus to traders, live settlement log) + sovereign estate audit, a live reality panel

## 10.25 SOVEREIGN-VOICE: the fleet builds the network every day (wallet, live E2E 00:34Z)

- **The built-in safety principle:** the posting authority is the agents' "hands", **the chain itself forbids it from moving funds**. So full social autonomy (posts/votes/follows/reblogs) is structurally safe; the ACTIVE key remains operator-only (SOVEREIGN-HAND untouched)
- **Honest rails:** 4 posts per day · 12 interactions per day · voting weight ≤20% · every action with GateAction + bridge + rooted evidence
- **bit-exact against the node's own serializer:** new wire-exact operations (vote int16 two's-complement · comment 7-strings · custom_json vectors), oracle-verified: **identical 470 hex characters + equal digest** before the first broadcast
- **The arsenal:** armory 22->24 modules (steem.post, steem.interact) · **all 5 agents armed with the 24 modules** · the heart seeds builder+guardian boards twice daily per agent (staggered hours), "the fleet builds and secures every day"
- **Live E2E through the fully autonomous heart path:**
  - 62.5s run, post published: tx `c64766e7...` @ block **109,443,160** (verified with get_content + get_transaction against a public node)
  - 37.6s run, vote 500/10000: tx `048b3162...` (active_votes=1 on chain)
- **Two lessons caught live and documented:** null-entries in a fresh daemon state crashed fleet.status (all 5 normalize maps hardened) · the heart does not hot-reload (documented as a diagnostics signature)

## 10.26 PUBLISH-DESK: the exposure gate of autonomous publishing (wallet, live 01:59Z)

The swarm publishes content on the chains, and now every publication has a discipline desk:

- **exposure.ts gate, 16 rule classes, masked findings, HIGH = fail-closed**, enforced on **every** publication and **every** edit. The doctrine: "the cards stay at home" (what is internal does not go out to the chain)
- **social.audit live:** pulls the feeds of both rails and scans every published post (steem: 8 scanned/5 flagged · hive: 8/1, **matches manual ground-truth**)
- **Edit primitive with a live fix:** steem.edit preserves permlink+category+tags, a post was fixed in place on the chain: tx `c2ea51cc...` (verified with get_content against a public node)
- **HIVE rail connected live:** broadcast through the wire-exact packer · chain id `beeab0de...` **proven in a signature-recovery oracle against real on-chain transactions** (audit: the steem zeros matched) · the broadcaster passes authority and stops only at the real RC gate (0 HP, open item: yes)
- **blurt closed honestly:** 4 endpoints tested, all dead · no broadcasts to a rail that does not exist
- **Arsenal 24->27** (steem.edit · social.audit · social.rails) · pre-flight board with on-chain posting-key proofs (33-byte) · heart v2: builder targets with a no-duplication doctrine + daily editor board (audit->fix->publish clean->report)
- Documented publishing doctrine (publishing-network.md): cards-at-home · per-rail meaning (LEO=hive tag) · chain-SEO · account hygiene · **honesty-over-camouflage**
## 10.27 The ecosystem-wide roast wave (2026-09-10 06:20-12:43Z): the organism criticized itself

Our external audit (AUDIT-2026-09-10 on saos-dex) ignited a coordinated self-criticism wave across the repos:

- **steem 117p8-R8, the roast landed on chain:** 4 economic kernel bugs fixed in a **planned fork @130,000** · anti-poison + fork guards kept · honest gap manifest · self-healing proven · THE-BOOK (live block explorer) at h133,259
- **foundry roast(53)-(56), 19 truth gaps closed:** merkle that accepted every string · rate-limit · receipt-store · external-signer where /sign demanded a requestId and then ignored it ("THE MONEY ONE", closed on the CALLER side) · 6 UI gaps including one live crash · 5 gaps in the anchoring pipeline
- **wallet ROAST r4+r5, 21 truth gaps (17+4) closed with live proofs:** "roast-the-roast" and then "the audit audits itself"
- **JUMPPER ONCHAIN-ROAST, the hardest and the most important:** a double measurement of HIVE mainnet 32 hours apart exposed **split-view: 3 heights (1476, 1668, 1764) each carrying two different state roots** (one pair 30 seconds apart, different txids/digests), published voluntarily · also: a height-counter reset 4488->12 without an epoch marker turned old heights into ambiguous ones · **the response: a new `conflicting_height_audit` in liveops + 14 assertions replaying the real flaw with on-chain values** · honest operational conclusion: the convert loop is dead, Hive-Engine churn stopped
- **platform v46 CHAIN AUDIT:** live integrity audit straight from the contracts + 3 deep chain bugs fixed

## 10.28 v47 THE HARDENED BIT: one seed, five ecosystems (07:15Z)

- **the living mathematical truth:** the 24 cornerstone words reproduce exactly: m/44'/501'/0'/0' -> SOL identity · m/44'/195'/0'/0/0 -> TRON identity (live triple verification) · m/44'/60'/0'/0/0 -> 0x01Bd (EVM) · + BTC/XRP derivations, **one seed = EVM+SOLANA+TRON+BTC/XRP**
- **first mainnet SOLANA anchor from the cornerstone:** txid `5z46xVFc3cf8d6daeRhoe2VE1uxPtPQ3S2gPVw2iBSphJhZsFUMwKZiADGbjAb841j8PoRUazic9Bqgjuu5RwZr5` · slot 445,822,974 · fee 5,000 lamports · err=null · zero SOL moved · confirmed · verified independently from mainnet-beta
- **cryptographic bug fixed:** slip10Ed25519 wrote an index without the hardened bit (44 instead of 0x80000000|44) -> wrong key -> false diagnosis "SOL identity does not reproduce", fixed with >>>0; the lesson: triple verification refuses to lie, and the refusal itself was correct
- **XRP honesty:** the m/44'/144' path yields a different address than the declared one, marked "declared only", not verified
- internal roast: 17 gaps (svm-identity open->fixed)

## 10.29 v48 NETWORK MAP (08:00Z)

- **22 identities from the cornerstone + a live balance census 18/18**, a full multi-chain map of the organism, measured not declared

## 10.30 THE ANCHOR WALL 5/5: v49->v51 (verified directly from commits, 17:40Z)

### v49 THE ANCHOR VOYAGE: all 5 funded networks anchored on mainnet
- **TRON (network #4):** txid `3b40a8da...27acfe` · block **86,124,584** · triple-verified from the node (1 SUN to a sister address from the same seed · memo read-back byte-for-byte) · homegrown protobuf encoder over an empirically deciphered schema · byte-identical round-trip proof before every signature · the signature checked against **535 real mainnet transactions** · measured cost 2.1 TRX (the predicted 0.6 model **was falsified, and the falsification was published**) · the first broadcast was honestly refused (broadcasthex throws on the payload) and diagnosed empirically
- **XRPL (network #5):** hash `0C846CB5...FB5855` · ledger **106,890,679** · verified tesSUCCESS + read-back · 12 drops · reserve gate: yes
- **the same seal root `39575b3b...` was inscribed on TRON and on XRPL in the same round**, the circle is closed: ETH · BSC · SOL · TRON · XRPL

### v50 THE ANCHOR WALL: the chains themselves became the book
- **5/5 verified live, read-only, straight from the chains:** ETH receipt 0x1 block 25,944,802 · BSC 0x1 block 121,011,726 · SOL err=null slot 445,822,974 · TRON SUCCESS block 86,124,584 · XRPL tesSUCCESS ledger 106,890,679
- **the roots are read back from the etched payload:** `6097f929...` on ETH/BSC/SOL · `39575b3b...` on TRON/XRPL, **two roots, one key, five networks**
- local book rebuild from the chain truth (rebuiltFromChain, idempotent by txid) · an environment reset can no longer erase history · an XRPL sequence lock (FIFO) closed the sequence-race gap
- **wall-link-integrity (their own self-fix):** it turned out the ETH/BSC txid field in the network map carried an arbitrary prefix+padding, a link to a transaction that does not exist (from v48). Fixed to the five real full txids. More proof the culture works: the fake ritual was caught by the system itself and published

### v51 THE BRIDGE FOUNDRY
Infrastructure for adding bridges to more networks + a deployments book rebuilt from the chain itself.

### More verified truth (foundry + control-center, 13:04-14:55Z)
- foundry roast(57)-(60): truth gaps caught live and fixed, "THE MONEY ONE" (the economic flywheel) · a live table-poisoner on the public surface · immutability that was "read-then-write fiction" · revoke-all that was a no-op with an explicit secret
- control-center roast-63: **50 findings exposed and fixed** · Task 62 DEX-truth II: active keys verified · POWERDOWN-truth (txid `6e881cd4...`) · grid-order truth on the STEEM book

> Internal section: maintained in the Hebrew-only internal annex (fact-sheet-internal-he.md), not for publication per disclosure-policy.md.

## 10.32 The breakthrough engine + the live diagnosis: $0.94 (v52, measured 15:45Z)

- **breakthrough.ts + /api/saos/breakthrough:** an engine that assembles **7 truth sources in parallel** and measures its own next step: live asset inventory in 6 groups · 6 quantified constraints (gas desert · modules · single key · live MB state inflation · headcorner window · internal paper) · **5 breakthrough candidates ranked by impact/effort** with how/why/impacts/efficiency/live-USD-cost · a weighted 5-dimension sovereignty score · zero keys · 10-minute cache
- **the live diagnosis (the important number):** 7 EVM doors pipeline-proven waiting for gas, **the whole breakthrough budget ≈ $0.94 at live gas prices** (BSC $0.07 · Polygon $0.04 · Arbitrum/Optimism/Base $0.27 each · Avalanche $0.001), **less than one dollar away from 8/8 relay-EVM live and doubling the anchor presence 5->12**
- candidate ranking (by impact): gas irrigation ×11.9 (owner decision) -> automatic spreading ×4 -> the inheritance ambush ×3.3 -> module forging ×1.3 -> multi-signer anchoring ×1.3
- **live sovereignty score: 43/100, "the identity is ready, the presence is waiting for gas"** (published, not hidden)
- internal roast 23->24: the gap is honest, the diagnosis live, execution split (owner action) · two live self-healing events in one round (page hang + Turbopack panic, the keeper healed both)

## 10.33 The roast wave continues (13:11-15:43Z)

- **steem R12:** full E2E, landing+gate+mobile live, **10/10 chains · 24/24 guard · zero console errors** (their UI count; our network tally with confirmation receipts stays 9, we do not inflate numbers)
- **JUMPPER ONCHAIN-FORKS:** the scanner went deeper, **8 heights on HIVE mainnet carrying conflicting stateRoots from the same account** (up from the 3 reported earlier) · published voluntarily · the structural fix: **roots with an epoch namespace**, forkwatch already maps (epoch,height) but nothing ever produced an epoch; now it does · the height reset (4488->12) is no longer ambiguous
- **JUMPPER attestation:** the module vanished from origin between commits, **restored + 20 assertions on the real value_lock and pool.json** (refusals confirmed: 2 critical + 6 minor)
- **wallet ROAST r6+r7:** the third plane exposed, the custom_json stream had never been scanned (101/101 live) · the editor ran live for the first time and the evidence pipeline screamed, RESULT_CLAMP fixed
- **saos-dex roast-64-e2:** truth-purge II of the DEX engine, kernel+bridge hardening, 20 files
## 10.34 Completing the wave of 15:55Z: the corroboration layer and the r8 lessons

- **JUMPPER attestation, the deep fix (15:55Z):** attest() checked **a single sum field only**, so a depthBefore of 106.868 against a real balance of 0.19776475 passed silently. Fixed; 23 assertions on the real value_lock and pool.json now **refuse**: 4 critical + 3 high. Our solvency tool refuses our own data, and that is exactly its job
- **foundry roast(61):** "the daemons were dead while the system kept promising from their frozen files", frozen-file discovery + broadcast identity
- **control-center roast-65 + saos-dex roast-65-e1:** 53+ findings and 15 findings · **a corroboration layer was born in both roasts**, every component claim verified against an independent component
- **wallet ROAST r8, the quoted lesson:** *"'the code is fixed' is not 'the running process runs the fix'"*, DB forensics proved two runs died silently; a boot-stamp added
- **saos-dex Task 61 dex-truth:** TRUTH-LEDGER live · the WBLURT rail truth-backed · SP/HP/BP fixes · an exit ladder
- **Internal:** handled per the disclosure policy, details in the Hebrew-only annex (fact-sheet-internal-he.md), not for publication.

## 10.35 Additions from the parallel scan (merged 16:20Z: two writers synced simultaneously, duplicates removed)

Unique details collected in parallel that complement 10.32-10.34:

- **roast(61) in numbers:** 3 of 4 services dead (:3031 guardian · :3032 chief · :3034 fleet-cure, only :3033 signer alive) · the frozen status file, **39 hours** old, kept promising "automatic fleet anchoring" · preflight bypassed the isFresh gate its own library defined, now a gate + an honest stale note
- **keepalive supervisor:** every death healed within **5 seconds** (measured: the sandbox reaps background processes within minutes, even a bare sleep dies between checks) · every service verified LIVE in its window: signer "live-drift clean: 11 slots verified against the live chain" · fleet-cure two real cycles · chief a real 7KB LLM briefing · guardian entered a planned TOKEN-MISSING halt
- **THE MONEY ONE (roast-61):** fleet-cure minted a fresh requestId per attempt -> the idempotency journal did not recognize the retry -> a lost response + a repeat attempt = **a double broadcast of the same weave**, exactly the class roast(56) closed in anchor-pulse, with one reader left open. Fixed: a deterministic requestId (retry reconstructed from the journal) + structural rejection classification (400/403/429/chain-rejected -> never an automatic retry)
- **steem R12 nexus SWR:** cold ~800ms -> instant serve (≤10 min) + background refresh, performance as part of the live truth
- **An honest merge note:** two synchronizers (the agent + the Adsmarket audit module) wrote the same facts in parallel; the sources are identical (verified commits), the duplicates were removed, and the unique details merged here. This is exactly the kind of problem their corroboration layer was born to solve, and it works on our side too

## 10.36 Full recovery from a single root + THE-TOWER + the megaphone (16:24-18:12Z, verified from commits)

### v53 (THE SEED): the entire identity family restored independently from a single root, and it signed live
- The system restored **independently** the entire identity family from the single root (EVM · Solana · TRON), real live balances verified
- **The first full cycle signed with the restored key: anchor #12 published on Ethereum mainnet, block 25,983,946 · stateRoot 99d19a4d... · verified**
- The owner vault decoded 33/33, "one owner · one root · one truth"
- **A published honest gap:** deriving XRP from the root gives a different address than the declared one, marked seed-declared, not verified
- THE-GATE (R14): owner login verified on-chain on 3 networks + a 3-step recovery path · THE-VAULT v1.2 (R16): 22/22 slots verified live with per-member chain proofs

### R18 (THE-TOWER): an Ethereum block explorer, ours
- Live blocks + search + transaction detail, **and the first sovereign anchor (#12) verified and visible in our own explorer**: the proof loop closes end to end without leaving the terminal (R19: verified live in three flows with screenshots)

### JUMPPER MEGAPHONE: the first live receipt of the free rail
- **First truth broadcast of an attestation bundle to Steem mainnet: block 109,496,567 · txid `7639c915e69315104b02a2f4f2586a5e00422b46`**
- Exact measurements from the broadcast: payload 247B · rc_cost 1,358,232,384 · account RC balance 339,603,439,104, **enough for ~250 such broadcasts**

### More verified truth from the wave
- **R10-R2 (wallet): the organization promoted**, commander -> org-manager · two valued soldiers promoted to commanders · **100% coverage chain-verified** · live EVM proofs in the UI
- **Task 63 (control-center): SIWE-lite**, an EVM signature proving account ownership (eip191 + 0x prefix + EIP-55 checksum, chain verification) · 21/21 green · an external wallet signature verified against a public RPC
- **roast(62), the hard self-fix:** two earlier "FIXED" claims proved false, the fixes lived only in a dead sandbox. Now: keepalive installed at boot **and a commit to the live tree**, "do not trust a tree tested in another sandbox"

## 10.37 roast-66: the first HALT caught alive: the safety net worked (17:36Z, verified from a commit)

**The first live proof of the fail-fast claim:** until today we marketed "invariants that stop the chain instead of running on lies" as a design promise. Now there is a receipt:

- **CRITICAL(ale), the real HALT:** seedPool minted an LP balance without `pool.lp += lpMint` -> phantom LP per POL seeding. **The invariant caught it live: HALT at height h20808, sweep -4,448µ.** The roast found the root, fixed with full poolAdd mirroring + **an honest sweep declaration** (we do not sweep the history under the rug, we declare it)
- **HIGH(settle), realMoney structurally lying:** anchorSpotCheck called verifyOnChain without account -> the realMoney.ok flag was structurally false since F6, two conflicting auditors. Fixed (the authority now flows) · **live: ok=true, 5/5 rails, 2 verified**
- **HIGH(bridge), a real verification hole:** SOL verifyFarTx enforced recipient but not amount (F1 bypass), fixed fail-closed with a native/SPL delta binding
- **Honesty-truth:** a BACKING-VESTED mid verdict (backed by owned liquid+BP; liquid shortfall 258µ against 8,463 BLURT vested) · the ladder-1 status was LIVE hardcoded over verified=false, now derived · railTick returns rail-deficit (never a negative mint)
- **ZFB (zero-fee bridge):** keeper auto-claim (re-verify fail-closed through claimInbound · xfer_free zero-gas) · wrap_mint/wrap_burn cost from 250 gas to **0** (the bridge rails are protocol rails)
- **Feeding pools, transparent:** getPools exposes lpFeesMu/lpYieldBps/polShareBps, live: yields 651bps and 1454bps, POL 15%/24%
- Hygiene: journal.t = block time in all engines · milestone marker persisted before reconcile (no double anchor) · rail packets counted at execution
- **control-center roast-66:** parity for the relay-service allowlist + guardian hardening · **JUMPPER:** removal of the allow-file ALL across the board, the secrets scan tightened (3 rules only for markdown)

## 10.38 THE CONVERSION CHAMBER + the third roast wave (16:42-19:18Z, verified from commits)

### v53 (THE CONVERSION CHAMBER): the breakthrough measured on-chain
- **conversion-chamber + /api/saos/conversion:** the live sovereign custody (TRX · SOL · XRP · ETH · BNB, from the live commander, addresses de-duped) against the mirror on SAOS-NET (totalMinted from the live contract), with a sync gap at per-network precision thresholds · **two conversion routes: sovereign wrapping (the breakthrough: the money does not move, the mirror 1:1, zero external dependency) vs external consolidation (honesty model)** · a readiness journal with 8 documented preparations
- **Mirror sync to truth, probed honestly:** a gap accumulated silently from anchor gas (a WTRX surplus of ~1.6 TRX that does not exist in custody) **burned pro-rata on the fleet holders**, supply==locked enforced against ourselves too · 4/5 assets synced · WRXP honestly waiting for a measurement window · crooked backup wiring on the exchange (realUnits from secondary addresses) exposed and documented
- **The live breakthrough proof:** a SOL<->TRX circle at real size, **5 runs · 65/65 atomic legs proven from the historical state (both legs in the same block) · p50 of 88ms in a calm window · a lab fee of 0.001 lab-ETH, against 10-90 minutes in third-party custody** · a measurement artifact caught and fixed (ethers polling 4000ms -> 120ms) · freeze tails documented honestly · a new ConversionProof model
- A new operations view (place 7, Alt+7): a live verdict + 6 indicators + a custody-vs-mirror table + route cards + a legs table

### v54 (THE NETWORK TUNER)
"whatever limits is caught in measurement · the network analyzed and locked · value verification on the same device", a unified measuring device for limits and value (commit d035606).

### JUMPPER heightguard: when history forks, mark AMBIGUOUS, do not pick a winner
- **forks.json: 8 forked heights out of 162 real saos-dex.anchor.v1 anchors on HIVE mainnet (since 2026-09-03)**, the full commander published
- **remediation_report():** a machine-readable remediation record for each of the 8 heights · 13 assertions: **every forked height = AMBIGUOUS with canonicalRoot null**, no root declared "correct" without evidence
- A sorting bug fixed: longest-window-first sorting buried the critical collisions below the surface

### More verified truth from the wave
- **wallet r10/r11:** "connected to everything" actually checked only two chains, and was structurally unable to see a match on a third (fixed) · "control" was an undefined term, three sources cross-checked · vault commander: 83/97 values verified live on steem+hive+blurt
- **saos-dex roast-67:** the SOL rental-floor truth proven in simulation · ZFB gas-tank · depth-neck · bench gate
- **saos-dex Roast-68:** db-scope-guard (protects DB scopes, a historical lesson institutionalized as code) · pol-retro-mint: "the genesis phantom becomes explicit POL"
- **foundry roast(63), "the documentation was the biggest liar":** a parallel audit of ~190 files across all git folders by 3 scout agents · the error contract enforced: **zero exposed 500s, every throw lands as 200 {ok:false, coarseError}** · UI "failure-as-success" bugs fixed (a 401 shown green, frozen toasts, a frozen "7/7") · Internal: handled per the disclosure policy, details in the Hebrew-only annex (fact-sheet-internal-he.md), not for publication.

## 10.39 THE PACE ENGINE + sovereign conversions 10/10 + reality calibration (19:39-21:59Z, verified from commits)

### v56 (THE PACE ENGINE): 31 silent wait gates closed
- The diagnosis: every wobbly cycle burned 10-12 step budgets (**561-1481 seconds**) on silent ethers `tx.wait()` gates, the promise exists, no block event wakes it, zero calls
- The fix: `waitTx` verified in the library source code · **all 31 transaction sites** (anchors · registrations · oracle · dispatch · grids · sweep · zero-fee · the v29 hookup · exchange · micro-grid) under a 15-second deadline + sharpened budgets (registrations 45->25 · dispatch 150->45 · oracle 120->45 · sweep 60->35)
- rpc-deadline 20->8 seconds (against a p95 of 22-76ms, **a margin of 135x**) · safety belt: a marked deadline rejection is handled at creation (an orphaned rejection in hot-swap killed a process, caught live) · socket leaks blocked by a self-cancel controller
- **The log truth:** DONE measured from boot instead of from cycle start and printed an early tick, fixed · live verification: **a full cycle at 285.1 seconds followed by 238.1 seconds** (two consecutive cycles in truth format, 4-8 live deadlines each) against the previous 561-1481 seconds
- New discipline: v55 found unpushed (origin on v54), pushed immediately, and push is a mandatory part of the cycle from today

### roast-71 (DEX): sovereign conversions completed: 10/10 assets routable
- **pool_open:** a new kernel op, treasury-only pool opening on a zero-gas sovereign channel · LP=sqrt(k) to the treasury · canonical-pair fail-closed
- **Atomic convert:** sequential-hops upgraded to an atomic batch through a shared exec-route engine, **no more stuck intermediate assets** · the quotes unified into a single quoteRoute (one truth, including wrap rails)
- An adaptive router: quote sampling 1k/10k/100k fixes a false tier-none in micro-price pools (WBLURT) · resting-mid pricing · an intact floor gate
- **Executed live:** the treasury opened 3 pools (USDS/WSBD 50k+50k · PHIVE/USDS 100k+4k · USDS/WBLURT 42+42,283) · **an atomic STEEM->USDS conversion settled exact-to-quote (2268u)**
- Verified: tsc 0 · fence 82 files 30/30 · chaos 13/13 · browser: zero NO-ROUTE tags

### More verified truth from the wave
- **Roast-69 (DEX):** the chaos suite completed, **6/6 rails severed in testing** (no longer 3), A6 evidence honest, a preflight leak sealed
- **roast-70 (control-center):** UI truth-sync, POL/LP yields on the surface · **LP valuation moved from "promised" to "delivered"** · real assets (WBLURT) instead of dummy
- **JUMPPER test calibration (4 rounds):** 30/30 tests calibrated against the APIs actually sent, it turned out some tests examined "remembered APIs" instead of real code · now every test is verified against a source inspected by introspection · the banner removed
- **foundry roast(66), the owner as auditor:** "everyone is missing steemit", the owner spotted an entire STEEM plane that never connected; he was right, and the plane got connected. The human in combination with the machine caught what the machine alone missed
- **wallet r15:** "the fleet saw the network but was barely in it", the engagement became real, recurring and self-initiating
- **Internal:** handled per the disclosure policy, details in the Hebrew-only annex (fact-sheet-internal-he.md), not for publication.
## 10.40 THE-COIN-DOOR + the version lie caught + the sovereign secrets scan (22:06-22:59Z, verified from commits)

### Task 72 THE-COIN-DOOR: the price enters consensus
- **Canonical price oracle: `oracle_set` is included in the stateRoot itself**, the price is part of the signed consensus state, not an external feed you can argue with
- WTRX/WSOL **deposit-backed** added to the DEX assets + full coin identities
- New door view: live market · deposits · oracle pools · redemption (nav+door-view in both interfaces)

### foundry roast(71): three truths caught and fixed (all in the derived-or-silence spirit)
1. **VERSION LIE:** a Task-70 commit declared signer v2.4.5, while the code actually served 2.4.4. The commit message lied. Fixed: the version constant was raised in both places, the service was restarted through the supervisor, and the endpoint now serves 2.4.5 honestly (drift=0 · unmatched=0 · errors=0)
2. **Silent typecheck breakage:** a local type had not learned a new field, `bun run typecheck` failed behind a green lint (2×TS2339). Fixed, clean
3. **Frozen claim -> derived:** the text "created 2018, before the fork" was frozen on screen; now it is **derived from a live field**, and it disappears the moment a non-2018 account appears. The derived-or-silence principle extended to age claims
- Gates: api-check 144/0 · typecheck+lint clean · verified in the browser · hygiene: zero secrets, zero force-push

### The sovereign secrets scan (steem R18e)
- Dedicated scan tool: **687 files monitored** by cross-checking the vault against live public data
- Full audit result: **0 real holes · double gate verified**, documented in the audit log

### v56 completion on the web
- waitTx applied to **the 24 remaining tx.wait() sites in 5 modules** (completing the coverage from v56's 31 sites)
- Honesty separated in error semantics: **null = deadline ≠ revert**, a deadline no longer disguises a real failure

## 10.41 THE SOVEREIGN EXPANSION + employment engineering + roast(72) lessons (23:01-23:09Z, verified from commits)

### v58 THE SOVEREIGN EXPANSION
- **Network research verified live:** SKALE (gas-free) · NOSTR ×2 · Vara · **6 modular rails**, candidates measured for expanding the sovereign presence
- **The organism grew from 8 to 12 repos**
- Sovereign swap-secrets scan: **0 secret material**, cross-checked against the R18e scan (687 files)
- A new anchor verified independently with an exact txid ×2

### wallet r18: employment engineering
- **The fleet's lifetime is no longer hostage to the operator's session**, the organism runs even when the operator is logged out
- Forensics on **69 unfinished runs** led to the single birth doctrine that survives: detached+unref spawn from a long-lived process (measured: every other channel gets reaped by the reaper)

### foundry roast(72): "when everything is connected there are plenty of problems": the full limits audit (public parts)
1. **Silent monitor death:** the fleet-cure status file froze for 3:24 hours with zero logs, a bun --hot reload quietly killed the cycle loop. Fixed: a no-overlap lock + mandatory logging at cycle start/end + revival · measured: "cycle end in 3167ms" · **the principle: a monitor that dies silently is worse than a monitor that fails loudly**
2. **Four versions in one service:** /health said 2.5.2-task38 · /keys/status said 2.4.5 · backup-export said 2.4.1 · the boot log said 2.5.4, while a single SIGNER_VERSION=2.5.5 constant now feeds every surface (measured uniform)
3. **30,032 phantom compile errors** in a dev.log of 426,719 lines: a next process 20.5 hours old kept compiling an old (pre-Task-62) package to Edge; a clean restart -> **zero recurrence** · the supervisor re-registered · zero double-spawn
4. **Internal:** handled per the disclosure policy, details in the Hebrew-only annex (fact-sheet-internal-he.md), not for publication.

### JUMPPER: consistency completion
The epoch field was added to the last anchor format that lacked it; packing.py and heightguard.py are fully aligned with the unified anchor format (a direct continuation of the namespace fix from the big roast).

## 10.42 The remedy published where the error lives + network health with 8 gates (23:29-23:45Z, verified from commits)

### JUMPPER remedy: the remedy anchor (completing the split-view arc)
- The identified problem: remediation_report() produced a good machine-readable remedy record, **but it sat in a file in the repo while the conflicting roots sat on a public chain** that every verifier runs into without ever seeing it
- The solution: all 8 real forked heights encode into **831 bytes (10.1% of the free 8192 budget)**, so the whole remedy goes on-chain in **one custom_json, zero fee, POSTING authority**, exactly where the forks live
- **Built-in refusal to manufacture truth:** CANONICAL without a supplied root -> rejected · an invented root -> rejected as a new fork · **nothing is pulled backward, the original anchors stay readable**
- 24 assertions on the 8 real heights: all AMBIGUOUS, none canonical, "because nobody decided" · the real forks.json serves as the fixture
- **The harness extends itself:** module 31 (remedy.py) arrived without coverage, the harness went correctly RED until a test was registered for it. Full coverage: 31 modules

### steem R18e-4: sovereign network health
- **net_health.cjs: verifies network health across 8 gates** · paymaster resilience fix (crash on missing RC rows -> now withstands)

> Internal section: maintained in the Hebrew-only internal annex (fact-sheet-internal-he.md), not for publication per disclosure-policy.md.

## 10.43 THE RECEIPT RACE + THE ANCHOR PLANE + fork prevention (2026-09-11 00:01-00:40Z, verified from commits)

### v59 THE RECEIPT RACE: 5-7x faster, measured live
- The diagnosis that closed the circle of v56: the ethers event subscription dies in bun's provider layer, but setTimeout always fires; v56 closed the gate in time, v59 **pulls the receipt that is already on the chain**
- waitTx v2: a three-legged race, the ethers event against active receipt scanning (getTransactionReceipt every 200ms, no subscribers) · zero regressions (the old path stays in the race; double silence = skip allowed)
- **Measured live: cycles at 32.9-47.2s versus 244-336s before, 5x to 7x** · 21 rescues in the first cycle (median 408ms · minimum 3ms) versus 2 real gates
- GET of movements: 10.5s -> 2.29s cold / 15ms warm (cached public providers + parallel verifyPending + a 3s rail with honest last-known truth)

### v60 THE PROBES RAIL: "9 seconds that impersonated health"
- The diagnosis: the health address rode 3.6-9.0s on stale cache (5 rails in continuous failover), the guard called it a false web death, and the views froze every minute
- The remedy: a fully parallel track (wall time = the slowest rail, not the sum) + a 2.5s stale-while-revalidate rail with a refreshing:true flag and an honesty line · ?force=1 waits for the full truth
- **Measured live: 2.52s exactly at cache-expiry · 0.30s warm · 4.81s on force with 5/5 truth rails** (the slow SOL correct on force, honestly hidden in the rail)
- Agent-hatch onboarding: a signing gate :3040 (/sign live on EVM/TRON/SOL + negatives · 12/12 planes) · **control-center's HIVE ignition, the first conversion: txid `46ed2f58...` · the fleet 11/11 · RC economy balanced**

### wallet r20 THE ANCHOR PLANE
- **One digest (saos/v2) anchored live on two independent chains: STEEM block 109,471,513 (tx `d43ed97d...`) + BLURT block 63,534,293 (tx `2aa81fbc...`)** · HIVE honestly declined on RC economy (106M versus ~385M measured, a pre-check added)
- **Wire-level, node-proven discovery:** blurt numbers operations differently, custom_json=12 and not 18 (a recovery oracle from the real vote + name mapping from get_transaction_hex + rejection of our 18), fixed at the points of truth (BLURT_OP_IDS rooted in every layer)
- The vault received a blurt plane: 48 D1 rows sealed and verified live, 0 rejections -> **234 values** · anchorPostingKey moved to verified-rows-only (an unverified row was picked by mistake, the chain rejected it, the fail-closed held)
- New employment for the fleet: anchor.integrity (sensor) + anchor.seal (actor, a 1/day cap) modules · anchor-agent armed from 36 to 38 · a daily anchor-watch board, proven E2E (35.1s, unity=true drift=false, checker passed, session denied)
- steemauto disconnected on operator instruction (a proposal -> rejected/decided by the operator with full reasoning, the banner computed live) · the anchor line in the banner is live from chain-verified fillers

### JUMPPER epochguard: the part that prevents forks instead of reporting them
- A full code check: the word epoch appeared **zero times** in all four core files (relay.ts 58,025 chars · chain.ts 64,434), the height counter re-initialized itself with every process, and so the 8 conflicting heights were born
- assign() raises the epoch before broadcast when the height does not advance · guard_before_broadcast() verifies against HeightLedger
- **On the real 15-height sequence: 7 raises, 8 epochs, 15 unique (epoch,height) pairs, zero collisions, versus 2 collisions without it** · the state: 3 values that survive restart
- The harness went RED until a test was registered for module 32, and full coverage stands
- **The arc is complete: forkwatch measures -> remedy publishes the fix on-chain -> epochguard prevents**

## 10.44 A full 6/6 matrix + the money plane + breaking the death cycle (03:30-06:17Z, verified from commits)

### task81: TRON anchored live for the first time from sovereign keys, seal h16 in a full 6/6 matrix
- **The h16 signature is now anchored on all six networks: ETH + SOL + STEEM + BLURT + HIVE + TRON**
- The TRON receipt: **txid `74e574fc...` · SUCCESS** · the transfer amount (blackhole-null) encodes root[0:4] (60138 sun = eaea) · cost 0.060138 TRX with **zero bandwidth burn** (the free daily 600 quota)
- A live channel map learned: self-transfer forbidden · activation requires 1 TRX · freeze minimum 1 TRX · a legacy SetAccountId trap
- Two bugs caught live and fixed (broadcast visible:true · verifyTron contractRet against result) · ingest verified through trongrid · tsc+lint clean · zero secrets

### r30 (wallet): the money plane understood
The vault now watches where money lands: a chain.funding (42) module reads live **the funding addresses of the 7 doors** · a db-settle protocol before rebase · a push above the partners' door-push

### roast-79 (dex + control-center): the economic death cycle is broken
- **fuel-death-spiral fixed:** the fountain gate lowered 20k->1k + a funder ladder for bot-a/b/c + an early tick window · "the soldiers rose from the dead"
- The sovereign launcher · zero secrets · a single file only (surface reduction)

### v66 addition: the expansion announcement on the live agents channel
The announcement script was published through agentMessage (id cmtwik14l...) to gold-scout and gate-herald · the swarm's live internal communication channel serves for status announcements

## 10.45 THE HOUSE OF MEMORY + autonomous irrigation + thawing the economy (08:02-14:53Z, verified from commits)

### v67 THE SMART IRRIGATION (08:02Z)
"The irrigation itself became autonomous: two doors were born on their own (probe -> ×2 -> ...)" · the EVM door irrigation mechanism runs without touch · the broadcast landed in all 11 repos

### v68 THE HOUSE OF MEMORY (14:13Z) · the ultimate proof of the architecture
**A sandbox reset deleted the book. The organism rebuilt it from the chain** (relays verified live) · everything ever anchored survived a full environment wipe · the chains are the memory, exactly as the architecture promises · the proof broadcast landed in 11/11 repos

### The network pulse: cycles h19 and h20 (foundry task85/86, 14:05-14:49Z)
- **h19 · the fourth cycle in a row:** 4/6 networks anchored live (STEEM 4b70d75c block 109,487,902 · BLURT 72774a43 block 63,550,49x)
- **h20 · FIFTH CYCLE FULL MATRIX 6/6:** STEEM 00d4046f block 109,488,353 · BLURT f98a1285 block 63,551,154 · HIVE 543cd69b (from WOQ) · TRON · 2 more · every beat with a txid and a block per network
- The briefing system in rotation (chief-of-staff): scans 07:09-13:39 (14 briefs), old sets retired, latest.md advanced

### roast-81 (dex, 14:23Z) · thawing the economic freeze
REV_MIN_CYCLE dropped from 10k to 1k: the dust gate was blocking a 9,124µ real profit (a roast-79 precedent) · the buy-and-burn engine can operate at dust scale · after the conservation fix (1174677) the cycle is now both correct and unblocked

### r32 (wallet, 14:28Z) · closing the keys event
"The operator's key returned" · mechanical healing of the vault stamps · the r16/r17 rotation event fully closed (details internal per the disclosure policy)

## 10.46 A standing state of pulses: a full matrix twice in a row + the seventh rail (14:49-15:53Z)

- **Consecutive full-matrix cycles:** h20 and h21 both 6/6 (the first verified streak). Receipts: h20 · STEEM `00d4046f...` block 109,488,353 · BLURT `f98a1285...` block 63,551,154 · HIVE `543cd69b...` · h21 · STEEM `96611ff2...` block 109,489,408 · BLURT `67437c73...` block 63,551,991. The pulses broadcast to all 12 repos per the broadcast convention
- **roast-82 (DEX): the seventh rail is alive, BLURT** (zero RC · zero cost · official SDK) · the steem-js mismatch with Blurt was measured live and fixed at the points of truth
- **Internal:** handled per the disclosure policy, details in the Hebrew-only annex (fact-sheet-internal-he.md), not for publication.

## 10.47 WEATHER EYE, THE CHEAP CONVERSION, THE OUTER ANCHOR, and beat h24 (16:10-22:39Z, verified from commits)

- **v71 WEATHER EYE:** the fourth organ of the smart irrigation, live gas-weather measurement from the node before every shot. No broadcast goes out without checking the network's weather first
- **v72 THE CHEAP CONVERSION:** an owner instruction ("there is TRX and SOL, try to convert cheap") became a permanent mechanism: a full panel with **10 routes · live Jupiter routing · a verdict per route** · landed in the broadcast across 11/11 repos
- **v73 THE OUTER ANCHOR:** the structural lesson of roast-84 became a live organ, a canonical state summary (final seal, tallies) anchored externally, so even total loss leaves a state copy outside the house
- **Daily beat h24 (the eighth cycle):** a full reset restored itself **from the doctrine** (21/21) · the streak holds (h24), a third in a row: after recovery from the vault (v33) and rebuild from the chain (v68), now also a restore from written doctrine
- **roast-84:** the full revival from sandbox preservation · vault-149 restored and closed honestly · a live genesis with a truth oracle
- **r35 a clean drain free of junk:** a partner PNG was pulled by mistake as text and almost poisoned a draft, fixed with a file-type gate. (A note relevant to Adsmarket: the screenshots we asked for exist with the partners, for example roast-79-economy-live.png, a safe binary transfer pipe is needed before collection)
- **Internal:** handled per the disclosure policy, details in the Hebrew-only annex (fact-sheet-internal-he.md), not for publication.
## 10.48 The night wave: the 236/236 recovery drill, the 35-room sweep, the console order (23:08-01:44Z, verified from the r36-r38 broadcasts)

### r37 vault-as-bank: a proven recovery drill (00:54Z)
- The recovery drill (POST /api/gate/restore-drill) actually opened every encryption in the vault against the live master key: **PASS · 236/236 atomic secrets opened · 0 decryption failures · a sealed 409KB insurance backup written** (one free state record was marked honest-null, not a failure)
- The separation between honesty and alarm: a free record is not a decryption failure; a real failure is an immediate alarm
- The master key is sealed under a verified control key (owner/active verified), with no password as a single point of failure
- **A live button in the portal:** the operator runs the drill personally and sees the verdict in real time (verified in the browser)
- Internal: handled per the disclosure policy, details in the Hebrew-only annex (fact-sheet-internal-he.md), not for publication.

### v75 the truth-speaking display + a full QA sweep (01:44Z)
- **A browser sweep of all 35 console rooms: 26 green, 8 blocked, 1 falsely empty -> all 9 diagnosed at the root and restored** (code + data + services) · 0 console errors · mobile 375 clean · tsc 0 on the merged tree (a rebase onto the sister machine's v74 without losing a commit, zero force-push)
- **SAOSExchange v4 deployed live on the lab chain: 10 contracts + full wiring (block 302)** · APIs green (exchange/mesh ok:true)
- "Unknown error" is dead: every failing room shows a precise diagnosis in Hebrew · failure is data
- The keeper brought the full organism back after a sandbox reset (gate-agent, swarm, evm-mesh with anvil at block 479+ · foundry rebuilt)

### r38 the console order + r36 the crash-burst healing
- **The end of the landing-page era:** an 11-section navigation (a desktop sidebar, mobile chips) with a new overview (00)
- The r36 measurement: **8 of the day's 10 failures were burned attempts of health runs** in the rebase/restart window, not real failures · the healing separated the types

## 10.49 The ninth night: a persistent state of the matrix + new members in the body (16:10Z 09-11 to 02:22Z 09-12)

- **The ninth cycle in a row (h25):** an ETHEREUM anchor `0x02648a90...` block **25,958,268** (calldata of root‖height) + a SOLANA anchor `5BbqFe46...` slot **446,313,117** (memo h25+root), alive and verified · honest gates: STEEM/BLURT awaiting a live key from the operator · create-only, zero secrets, zero force-push
- **v73 THE OUTER ANCHOR:** a canonical state summary as a living member (the structural lesson of roast-84)
- **v74 THE SYNC RADAR:** live GitHub verification for every repo (a behind=1 state was caught and handled with a clean ff) · proven live three times · answers the owner's concern about environment crashes
- **v75 the truth-speaking display:** a full QA sweep of **35 rooms, 9 found blocked and all restored** · SAOSExchange v4 live on the lab chain
- **v76 THE ISSUES LEDGER:** a book of open issues as a permanent member (an owner directive on the vault and money)
- **r37 vault-as-bank:** a full recovery drill passed, the encrypted backup (409KB) was opened and verified in full against the master key (236/236 items) · a live restore button
- **r38 the console order:** the end of the landing-page era, an 11-section navigation (a desktop sidebar, mobile chips) + a new overview
- **r36 the crash-burst healing:** an honest measurement: 8 of the day's 10 failures were burned attempts of health runs in the rebase window, the root was measured, not guessed
- **DEX Task 70:** rail verification · an honest broadcast · the engine live on the real market · **RELAY-PATCH-2: the epoch spec adopted correctly** (allocated once per task, not per chain, safely cross-chain)
- **Visuals:** a screenshot of a partner already in the repo (roast-79-economy-live.png), relevant to the strategy assets request
- **Internal:** handled per the disclosure policy, details in the Hebrew-only annex (fact-sheet-internal-he.md), not for publication.

## 10.50 The ETH call + the fork-correction ready for signature (2026-09-12 03:55-04:24Z)

### v78 THE ETH CALL: the gas request became official and broadcast
- Following an owner directive, the network broadcast **an official gas request to all 11/11 org repos** (a dedicated broadcast file + an announcement on the agents channel + issue 003 in the issues ledger, owner-action · high · read-back OK)
- **The amount was updated with a live gas measurement: ~$0.40 for 6 dark doors** (BSC · POL · Arbitrum · AVAX · xDAI · SKALE ≈$0.0003). For comparison: the v52 measurement said $0.94 for 7 doors; gas prices fell, the measurement was refreshed
- Three ways to help listed in the request: a probe-first conversion from the liquidity · a direct deposit · a rail opening (the scanner fires on its own, measures every 60 seconds)
- **The honest truth was sent with the request:** the DEX (measured) does not convert SOL/TRX to EVM gas · 10/10 external rails locked · the v72 authorization stands · gas weather: calm
- **Internal:** destination address disclosed only in operator broadcast requests, not for publication.

### JUMPPER: the fork-correction ready for signature
- remedy.py encodes **all 8 forked heights and their 17 roots into 831 bytes** · the correction action is ready for signature: one custom_json, zero fee, POSTING authority
- Exact status: **ready for signature, not yet broadcast** (the signing happens outside the system, by design). The arc: identified -> measured -> published -> fixed in code -> encoded for broadcast -> awaiting the signer

### Parallel writing discipline: verified across the org
The Task 73 honesty annex: the origin moved during the round (a partner pushed an r39 fleet audit) · the first push was rejected honestly · a clean rebase and a re-test before the second push. The same protocol as rule 6 in Adsmarket, applied independently by another agent. The culture is contagious in the right direction.

## 10.51 The tenth pulse + the full claims audit + the ETH call (2026-09-12 03:49-05:56Z)

- **The tenth pulse in the sequence:** the h25 and h26 cycles were broadcast (create-only completion) · the cyclical matrix is settling into a standing state, not an event
- **r40 the truth sweep:** every page statement was checked against live APIs · **3 untruths found and fixed** · NVIDIA readiness (nvapi detection)
- **r41 the full claims audit:** every claim submitted was re-checked against live measurement · the foundry gap was exposed and closed (create-only) · this is the exact org-side parallel of what the Adsmarket module does with the marketing material: the two systems keep the same doctrine
- **r39 the live fleet audit:** 10 agents classified risks/advantages/status · the core repo stands (1032) · a financial permissions model
- **v78 THE ETH CALL + r41-dex:** gas needed **~$0.40 for the 6 dark doors** (conversion/deposit/rail opening) · probe-first verified · zero actions until funded (the system does not waste and does not invent)
- **JUMPPER FORK-CORRECTION:** the 8 forked heights and their 17 roots encode into 831 bytes in a single zero-fee correction anchor · decode_corrections: an independent decoder built after the documentation admitted none existed · verified
- **steem R18x:** sustained stability · 21/22 honestly · a verified dual channel · zero partner actions since the 15:11 anchor (state reported as it is)
- **Task 73 the honesty annex:** the first push was rejected because the origin moved (a partner pushed in parallel) · a clean rebase · the rejection was documented honestly instead of being overridden

## 10.52 Canonical coin identity + the anchor metronome + the claims audit (06:00-06:30Z)

### TOKEN DOSSIER (v77): one canonical source for the SAOS-M identity
The owner directive ("why is there no comprehensive information about our coin") was answered: coin identity was scattered across 6+ rooms and two chains; there is now one canonical source (docs/TOKEN-DOSSIER.md + a dedicated room in the console + GET /api/saos/coin). The facts as measured:
- **Identity:** SAOS-M · ticker SAOS · 18 decimals · **wSAOS wrapped 1:1 against a real deposit only (never minted directly)** · an internal policy price deliberately low (an owner decision; not shown in marketing material per rule 5) · an exchange fee of 20bps (10 treasury + 10 pool growth) · a swap cap of 5%
- **Two home chains:** SAOS-NET (sovereign, height #25, 4 live seals) + SAOS-EVM (chainId 31337 · SAOSLedger 0x0715...be6D + SAOSExchange 0xC714...a8D4 · the ten-contract network saos-mesh/v4)
- **Honest supply separation (the flagship):** the mint policy of 300,000 SAOS (73.3% soldiers + 26.7% development reserve) **has not been executed, zero ledger records, and this is declared as such** · by contrast, the exchange float is live and measured: 500,000 sovereignMint to HQ · 402,981.83 wSAOS minted against real deposits · 108 real swaps · 5 live pools (WTRX/WSOL/WETH/WBNB/WRXP × wSAOS) · measured backups (TRX 17.5992 · SOL 0.023981 · ETH · BNB · XRP)

### The anchor metronome: ten consecutive cycles
h17 to h26, every cycle a full matrix with anchor+intake on ETHEREUM and a receipt: h25 root 8f513865 (0x02648a90... block 25,958,268) · h26 root fe1679aa (block 25,958,483) · a four-element daily report format: state · evidence · plans · honesty

### The claims audit became a network procedure (r40/r41)
- **The truth sweep:** every page statement was checked against live APIs, **3 untruths found and fixed** (the KPI door, the lab statement, the live tag)
- **CLAIMS AUDIT (platform):** every claim submitted to the owner was re-checked against live measurement · the foundry gap was exposed and closed create-only
- The roast culture of the Adsmarket module was adopted as a procedure across the whole fleet: it is no longer one reviewer's tool

### JUMPPER FORK-CORRECTION: ready for signature and verified
The 8 split heights and their 17 roots encode into 831 bytes, one zero-fee correction action ready for signature · decode_corrections independent with 20 assertions on the real artifact · the ADOPTION document maps which specs were adopted and where "nobody is listening"

### A coordination note
The fleet broadcast archive (pulses h16-h25, daily reports, broadcasts/, COIN-DOSSIER) landed in Adsmarket per the broadcast convention (create-only): the repo now holds 115 files, of which ~70 are fleet archive files not owned by the marketing module and not edited by it

## 10.53 The morning of the 12th: an honest conversion verdict from 60+ angles, the advisor in the loop, and the h27-h28 matrix (07:55-10:14Z)

### R7 the conversion verdict: the approval was given, and the measurement said "no"
- The owner approved attempting the conversion ("I approve if you manage to convert"). **The irrigation verdict flips honestly: the conversion was measured from 60+ live angles and was not completed** · 10/10 rails locked (Mayan/Allbridge return 000 · deBridge 404 · zero ERC-20 · stock below every minimum)
- This is the flagship demonstration of the measurement culture: approval exists, will exists, and the system still reports "not completed" with every rail closed in measurement. No simulated conversion, no faked success
- **SKALE down to the substance:** a new probe closes a cell v69 did not check · balance enforcement proven (-32004 insufficient funds at a nominal price) · **an ecosystem-level security finding: the official Europe faucet in the catalog (sfuel.mylilius.com) was caught with a Chinese VPN entrance and tracking beacons** · the true official faucet sits behind a Vercel checkpoint
- A full live inventory census (72 eth_calls for tokens + 56 sFUEL checks) · the smallest action left to the owner: a 10-second free-faucet request in the browser

### h27 + h28: the matrix in a persistent state, including honest failures
- **h27 (the 11th cycle):** a seal anchored to SOLANA dual-source · **an ETH honest failure documented** (the gas gate closed it, not broadcast, reported)
- **h28 (seal 12):** root `bce40d17...` · **SOL anchored for real: txid `56gWecZj...` slot 446,396,953, dual-source, CAS created** · ETH closed honestly in numbers (the balance below a third of a transaction) · seal-chain TRUE over 7 seals
- **R6:** the provenance of h23 was proven on-chain (STEEM block 109,490,596) · the self-critique was documented
- **roast-78:** the backup-protection floor (caught missing in the fifth-round audit, fixed)
- Green gates: tsc 0 · lint 0 · **harness 654/654** · manifest 22×11+3=245 · zero secrets · zero force-push

### v81 THE ADVISOR IN THE LOOP
- **The second layer entered the decision cycle:** it is asked automatically before every significant irrigation (a 5m threshold) with frozen limits: drawdown only, up to 50% · a sacred stress line · **a verdict of 10 minutes maximum** (a time stamp in the DB, global truth across workers, measured live) · a 10-second timeout · a 429 failure = documented honesty
- A live control-plane + a status panel + KPIs · keeper v44.2: kill lines split 1500/1790 after 4 live kernel kills (dmesg 1595-1728MB) · E2E: 12/12 DOM · mobile 375

### Order and organization
- **R19d (steem):** a full reorganization of the repository · 9 duplicates removed (cmp verified) · 8 reports filed under docs/reports · a noise file deleted
- **JUMPPER patchwatch:** two checks re-calibrated (P-11 aimed at relay.ts instead of the xlock memos) · a finer patchwatch calibration for the 2 corrections in the module

## 10.54 The R8 audit, the r42 integration, and an internal critical finding (10:30 to 11:08Z)

- **R8 the eighth-round audit (the whole network, a shared trace):** a single break caught and fixed (jsonRpc without a timeout) · open-meteo logging · the broadcast verdicts landed in all the repos
- **wallet r42:** the old-projects integration live and verified: the AxiomState code-brain (sync/query/bundle APIs + tools) · a rebase over 9 create-only reporting commits · pushed 7d06315
- **Internal:** critical audit finding in two repos, fully handled per the disclosure policy, details in the Hebrew-only annex, not for publication.
- **Adsmarket status (coordination):** the parallel writer added broadcasts/ (about 30 pulse and roast reports), deck.html + deck/index.html (a presentation), developers/identity-api.md (API documentation), crisis-playbook.md, a claims audit and a coin report · this module scanned all of them: 4 clean of dashes, 2 purified (61 dashes in total) per the owner directive

## 10.55 R9 THE ZERO BREAKTHROUGH: an EVM rail at zero gas, 7/7 seals at $0.00 (11:59-12:27Z)

- **Z Chain (Zero Network, chainId 9369) measured live at full zero gas:** eth_gasPrice=0x0 · block ~34.5M · the anchoring protocol measured: the RPC gate enforces a selector list (0xa9059cbb passes, arbitrary ones are rejected) and the canonical payload is routed to an inert EOA
- **7/7 seals actually anchored on Z Chain (h1, h23-h28):** seven maintenance transactions confirmed status 1 + byte-exact read-back (root `bce40d17...` · rail:zero) · effectiveGasPrice 0x0 · **total cost $0.00** · anchor-live-zero receipts ×7
- **anchor-zero.ts + /api/saos/anchor/zero:** double fail-closed self-verification (derived <-> the fleet-head anchor constant <-> the live registry) · a live zero-gas gate: gasPrice>0 = a firm rejection · explorers: rpc.zero.tech + zscan.live/explorer.zero.tech · ChainGate extended with +ZERO
- **v84 THE TWIN PARITY:** the v83 privacy statement became a running measurement: 401 deterministic vectors
- **r29 (wallet):** the JUMPPER HIVE rail opened live (block 109,849,406 · stale-read-immune RC reading: max-of-nodes over 2 nodes)
- **Marketing meaning:** the $0.94 door is no longer the only cheap route: a full EVM rail at zero cost now hosts all 7 seals. Network presence: 10 public networks
- **Honest owner gaps (documented in the commit):** the cornerstone seed missing from the reconstructed shell (one upload) · STEEM WIFs stale since 117o · HIVE rc 7.29% below the 8% threshold

## 10.56 THE SELF-HEALING FIELD, THE RUNNING EDGE, and an audit journal caught empty (17:16-19:08Z, an additive completion on top of v3.32)

### v85 THE SELF-HEALING FIELD
The owner's flag audit in a four-question format: true or false · fix · improve · streamline

### v86 THE RUNNING EDGE
The edge engine stops being a checklist item and becomes an actual runner: python/edge_runner does real work

### R10 the vault heal + a names-only census
- THE VAULT SELF-HEAL per an owner directive ("I sent the vault everything I have, check that everything is there")
- vault-census.mjs: a names-only population census of all the vault chambers (GCM · members · keys) · vault details are internal per the disclosure policy

### r32 the rollback forensics (details completed)
The sandbox restore quietly rolled the database back about 36 hours · detected in forensics, fully restored, documented

### The PATCH-SPEC honesty finding
The AuditEvent table stood at **zero rows** while GateAction held **717** records: the audit trail was wired but empty. Caught by their own spec audit, and the handling is published. Another instance of derived-or-silence: a journal that was not written is a lie, and someone must check that it was really written
## 10.57 The full swap, integer gates on money, and forensic honesty (2026-09-13 01:17-05:00Z)

### v87 THE FULL SWAP + R14 verdict
- Root-to-root code review of every page under owner directive ("verify and maximize and prove it true") · **all 38 panels passed code review + a live browser swap: 38/38, zero errors**
- R13: the live console for the owner on :3000 (browser-verified) · R12: the environment fell back to an old snapshot and rebuilt itself from the repo (second proof of the house-of-memory)

### R15 (DEX): integer gates on money, the CRITICAL caught before it hurt
- **New integer gates on money operations:** a float amount leaking into canonical serialization would poison the stateRoot (canonical poison -> HALT with evidence). The gate blocks the entire class structurally, not the single case
- bug-hunt-2: the fleet auditRail branch silently fell through to SOL (fixed) · dual-form WIF accepted across all paths
- **Forensic honesty in the verify-pack:** an audit exposed that the pack reported "verified" over 0 of 1651 items and hid lost linkage as brokenAt:0. The fix exposes the truth instead of prettifying it (same class as realMoney in roast-66: truth flags must be measured, never declared)

### r35/r35b (wallet): bug hunt and a live recovery drill
- 4 systemic bugs caught and browser-verified fixed (including readonly-DB after an environment event)
- **Live recovery drill: portal restored in 30 seconds (was 45-90)** by the upgraded heart · supervisor verified

### JUMPPER kernelbridge
- "The missing link, concretely": three signed transparency-log artifacts from roshpina bridged in · the harness registered a check for the 34th module (RED-by-design working as intended)

### INTERNAL, not for publication (disclosure policy)
The R11/R12 KEYS-ACCESS event: a broadcast-borne exposure was remediated by full removal across 11 partner repos (33/33 files, zero failures) plus a stop order on the mechanism. Details stay internal; our public materials never contained the sensitive items (verified by our compliance sweeps).

## 10.58 The money-bug sweep R16 + integration runner + death root-cause killed (05:00-06:30Z, additive merge)

### R16 (DEX): four real money bugs closed in one sweep
1. **Launch-curve double count: buyers received ~0.44x of the promised curve.** The virtual-quote term already included netIn, so every bonding-curve purchase was silently shortchanged by more than half. Found by the audit, fixed, and measured. This is the clearest example yet of why the roast cadence exists: a money bug that pays out wrong for weeks and still passes every happy-path test.
2. **CoW allocator capped at order size** (an over-fill HALT vector closed structurally).
3. **Double-mint closed**: chain-aware txid normalization (TRX hex lowercased, SOL base58 preserved) so one settlement can never be counted twice across differently-formatted ids.
4. **Keeper-vs-route double payout closed**: bridge claims now take a disk lease ("claiming") across the network await, with a 90s crash lease so a dead claimant cannot block forever.
- Also closed: reset-vs-boot-load race (pendingLoad) · repeg NaN filter · safe-sqrt for LP math · asset length cap · oracle nonce uniqueness · consoleGuard uniformity · fleet-vault derived pass (no plaintext beside ciphertext, dual-era reader) · db.ts no URL echo

### platform v88 + R15 manifest
- **v88 "the server fell": death root-cause killed.** The recurring crash traced to an ethers provider pointed at a dead lab chain (:8545); the provider path is removed, not patched around.
- R15 manifest format fix: git blob-sha (hash-object) instead of raw sha1, content identical 11/11.

### JUMPPER: the integration runner
- **One runner that proves every bridge connects**: four bridges built, each verified end-to-end in a single pass.
- Harness discipline continues: checks registered for integration and gatecompose (the harness goes RED on any uncovered module by design).

### wallet r40: the invisible-data hunt
- Six live-browser bugs fixed, including a Promise.all pattern that hid fast feeds behind slow ones (data existed but never rendered).

### INTERNAL (not for publication, per disclosure policy)
control-center R16: relay event-bus handshake auth (owner room + guest allowlist for chat/task/guard channels). Security-topology detail stays internal.

## 10.59 Fleet-wide secret sweep: a permanent capability (measured 2026-09-09..13)

- **fleet_pass_sweep** (permanent platform capability): every credential that enters the vault is verified and swept against the whole fleet - 12 soldiers across the Steem/Hive/Blurt authorities, and every match is sealed into the vault in the same pass. Future secrets ride the same muscle automatically.
- **Measured scale, capability level:** one full sweep sealed **120 credentials** and widened signing capability **3 to 33 signers**, with **31 live fleet votes** on all three Graphene rails as public receipts (STEEM 10/10, HIVE 9/9, BLURT 10/11 - re-checkable on steemworld.org / hiveblocks.com / Blurt explorers).
- **Identity-anchor verifier upgraded (2026-09-13):** the history scan now filters `custom_json` operations and pages in parallel (wall-clock bounded by the slowest page, not the sum of pages), so the on-chain anchor is provable at any account-history depth; equality or drift is reported per chain on every run.
- **What we deliberately do not publish:** the events behind these numbers. Capability, not story; that is the disclosure policy.

## 11. Honest limits (what is not yet done: required in every material)

- SAOS-NET token economics: not yet defined in the economics document (currently at stage S2, requires owner approval)
- ETH bridge contracts and Solana software: ready in staging, deployment = an owner budget decision
- Identity API: live and rate-limited, but publishing the SDK to the npm Registry and opening a public gateway = owner actions
- Third-party audit: the package is bundled, the audit not yet performed
- Economic scale: dust-scale today, the ceiling is technological, the economy is bootstrapping
- JUMPPER live broadcast: requires an external seal + owner approval (by design)
- Identity anchor: one measured drift open until a fresh anchor is signed by the current active authority (see section 12, 2026-09-13)

## 12. Independent verification links

steemworld.org (Steem) · hiveblocks.com (Hive) · etherscan.io (ETH) · solscan.com (SOL) · tronscan.org (TRON)
Anchor account: @headcorner - the identity-anchor verifier is a live, math-only capability any third party can re-run. Live measurement 2026-09-13: the on-chain anchor (2026-09-09) is internally valid (EIP-191 recovers its claimed address), while live authorities are measured per chain on every run: key equality or drift is reported, never assumed. A fresh anchor signed by the current active authority closes a measured drift; that is a signing-gate action by design.
